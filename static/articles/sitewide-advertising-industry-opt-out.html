            <p>The <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ads.txt-1.0.3.pdf">ads.txt specification</a>
            provides a way to list the authorized sellers of ads for a domain. The
            <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/app-ads.txt-v1.0-final-.pdf">app-ads.txt specification</a>
            extends this to cover apps tied to the domain. As a domain owner, this is a valuable
            way to crack down on fraudulent usage of your domain including by adware.</p>

            <p>For domains without any third party advertising including those without any ads at
            all, you should serve both <code>/ads.txt</code> and <code>/app-ads.txt</code> from a
            web server with the placeholder record defined by the specification:</p>

            <pre>placeholder.example.com, placeholder, DIRECT, placeholder</pre>

            <p>The placeholder record formally disallows buying and selling ads on behalf of the
            domain including for any subdomains. This prevents fraudulently buying and selling ads
            for your domain anywhere that ads.txt and app-ads.txt are enforced.</p>

            <p>It's in the interest of most ad tech companies to enforce these standards due to
            losses from ad fraud so adoption is increasingly widespread.</p>

            <p>Browser extension malware injecting ads into sites is very common and this is a way
            for sites to hurt those malware developers where it hurts: their pocketbook.</p>

            <p>These standards have a limited scope and were primarily created to address the cost
            of ad fraud for the advertising industry, but they do offer value for domain owners to
            protect their reputation and discourage adware.</p>
