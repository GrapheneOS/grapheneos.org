            <h1><a href="#server-traffic-shaping">Server traffic shaping</a></h1>

            <p>This article covers implementing server traffic shaping on Linux with CAKE. The aim
            is to provide fair usage of bandwidth between clients and consistently low latency
            for dedicated and virtual servers provided by companies like OVH and others.</p>

            <p>Traffic shaping is generally discussed in the context of a router shaping traffic
            for a local network with assorted clients connected. It also has a lot to offer on a
            server where you don't control the network. If you control your own infrastructure
            from the server to the ISP, you probably want to do this on the routers instead.</p>

            <p>This article was motivated by the serious lack of up-to-date information on this
            topic elsewhere. It's very easy to implement on modern Linux kernels and the results
            and impressive from extremely simple test cases to heavily loaded servers.</p>

            <section id="problem">
                <h2><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

                <p>A server will generally be provisioned with a specific amount of bandwidth
                enforced by a router in close proximity. This router acts as the bottleneck and
                ends up being in charge of most of the queuing and congestion decisions. Unless
                that's under your control, the best you can hope for is that the router is
                configured to use <code>fq_codel</code> as the queuing discipline (qdisc) to
                provide fair queuing between streams and low latency by preventing a substantial
                backlog of data.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the Linux kernel still defaults to <code>pfifo_fast</code>
                instead of the much saner <code>fq_codel</code> algorithm. This is changed by a
                configuration file shipped with systemd, so <em>most</em> distributions using
                systemd as init end up with a sane default. Debian removes that configuration and
                doesn't set a sane default itself, and is widely used. Many server providers like
                OVH do not appear to use consistently use modern queue disciplines like
                <code>fq_codel</code> within their networks, particularly at artificial
                bottlenecks implementing rate limiting based on product tiers.</p>

                <p>If the bottleneck doesn't use fair queuing, division of bandwidth across
                streams is very arbitrary and latency suffers under congestion. These issues are
                often referred to as bufferbloat, and <code>fq_codel</code> is quite good at
                resolving it.</p>

                <p>The <code>fq_codel</code> algorithm is far from perfect. It has issues with
                hash collisions and more importantly only does fair queuing between streams.
                Buffer bloat also isn't the only relevant issue. Clients with multiple connections
                receive more bandwidth and a client can open a large number of connections to
                maximize their bandwidth usage at the expense of others. Fair queuing is important
                beyond as a solution to bufferbloat and there's more to fair queuing than doing it
                only based on streams.</p>

                <p>Traditionally, web browsers open a bunch of HTTP/1.1 connections to each server
                which ends up giving them an unfair amount of bandwidth. HTTP/2 is much friendlier
                since it uses a single connection to each server for the entire browser. Download
                managers take this to the extreme and intentionally use many connections to bypass
                server limits and game the division of resources between clients.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="solution">
                <h2><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

                <p>Linux 4.19 and later makes it easy to solve all of these problems. The CAKE
                queuing discipline provides sophisticated fair queuing based on destination and
                source addresses with finer-grained fairness for individual streams.</p>

                <p> Unfortunately, simply enabling it as your queuing discipline isn't enough
                since it's highly unlikely that your server is the network bottleneck. You need to
                configure it with a bandwidth limit based on the provisioned bandwidth to move the
                bottleneck under your control where you can control how traffic is queued.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="results">
                <h2><a href="#results">Results</a></h2>

                <p>We've used an 100mbit OVH server for as a test platform for a case where
                clients can easily max out the server bandwidth on their own. As a very simple
                example, consider 2 clients with more than 100mbit of bandwidth each downloading a
                large file. These are (rounded) real world results with CAKE:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>client A with 1 connection gets 50mbit</li>
                    <li>client B with 10 connections gets 5mbit each adding up to 50mbit</li>
                </ul>

                <p>CAKE with <code>flows</code> instead of the default <code>triple-isolate</code> to
                mimic <code>fq_codel</code> at a bottleneck:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>client A with 1 connection gets 9mbit</li>
                    <li>client B with 10 connections gets 9mbit each adding up to 90mbit</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The situation without traffic shaping is a mess. Latency takes a serious hit
                that's very noticeable via SSH. Bandwidth is consistently allocated very unevenly
                and ends up fluctuating substantially between test runs. The connections tend to
                settle near a rate, often significantly lower or higher than the fair 9mbit
                amount. It's generally something like this, but the range varies a lot:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>client A with 1 connection gets ~6mbit to ~14mbit</li>
                    <li>client B with 10 connections gets ~6mbit to ~14mbit each adding up to ~86mbit
                    to ~94mbit</li>
                </ul>

                <p>CAKE continues working as expected with a far higher number of connections. It
                technically has a higher CPU cost than <code>fq_codel</code>, but that's much more
                of a concern for low end router hardware. It hardly matters on a server, even one
                that's under heavy CPU load. The improvement in user experience is substantial and
                it's very noticeable in web page load speeds when a server is under load.</p>

            <section id="implementation">
                <h2><a href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h2>

                <p>For a server with 2000mbit of bandwidth provisioned, you could start by trying
                it with 99.75% of the provisioned bandwidth:</p>

                <pre>tc qdisc replace dev eth0 root cake bandwidth 1995mbit besteffort</pre>

                <p>On a server, setting it to use 100% of the provisioned bandwidth may work fine
                in practice. Unlike a local network connected to a consumer ISP, you shouldn't
                need to sacrifice anywhere close to the typically recommended 5-10% of your
                bandwidth for traffic shaping.</p>

                <p>This also sets <code>besteffort</code> for the common case where the server
                doesn't have appropriate Quality of Service markings set up via Diffserv. Fair
                scheduling is already great at providing low latency by cycling through the hosts
                and streams without needing this kind of configuration. The defaults for Diffserv
                traffic classes like real-time video are set up to yield substantial bandwidth in
                exchange for lower latency. It's easy to set this up wrong and it usually won't
                make much sense on a server. You might want to set up marking low priority traffic
                like system updates, but it will already get a tiny share of the overall traffic
                on a loaded server due to fair scheduling between hosts and streams.</p>

                <p>You can use the <code>tc -s qdisc</code> command to monitor CAKE:</p>

                <pre>tc -s qdisc show dev eth0</pre>

                <p>If you want to keep an eye on how it changes over time:</p>

                <pre>watch -n 1 tc -s qdisc show dev eth0</pre>

                <p>This is very helpful for figuring out if you've successfully moved the
                bottleneck to the server. If the bandwidth is being fully used, it should
                consistently have a backlog of data where it's applying the queuing discipline.
                The backlog shouldn't be draining to near zero under full bandwidth usage as that
                indicates the bottleneck is the server application itself or a different network
                bottleneck.</p>

            <section id="quicker-backpressure-propagation">
                <h2><a href="#quicker-backpressure-propagation">Quicker backpressure propagation</a></h2>

                <p>The Linux kernel can be tuned to more quickly propagate TCP backpressure up to
                applications while still maximizing bandwidth usage. This is incredibly useful for
                interactive applications aiming to send the freshest possible copy of data and for
                protocols like HTTP/2 multiplexing streams/messages with different priorities over
                the same TCP connection. This can also substantially reduce memory usage for TCP
                by reducing buffer sizes closer to the optimal amount for maximizing bandwidth
                use without wasting memory. The downside to quicker backpressure propagation is
                increased CPU usage from additional system calls and context switches.</p>

                <p>The Linux kernel automatically adjusts the size of the write queue to maximize
                bandwidth usage. The write queue is divided into unacknowledged bytes (TCP window
                size) and unsent bytes. As acknowledgements of transmitted data are received, it
                frees up space for the application to queue more data. The queue of unsent bytes
                provides the leeway needed to wake the application and obtain more data. This can
                be reduced using <code>net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat</code> to reduce the default and
                the <code>TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT</code> socket option to override it per-socket.</p>

                <p>A reasonable choice for internet-based workloads concerned about latency and
                particularly prioritization within TCP connections but unwilling to sacrifice
                throughput is 128kiB. To configure this, set the following in
                <code>/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf</code> or another sysctl configuration file and
                load it with <code>sysctl --system</code>:</p>

                <pre>net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat = 131072</pre>

                <p>Using values as low as 16384 can make sense to further improve latency and
                prioritization. However, it's more likely to negatively impact throughput and will
                further increase CPU usage. Use at least 128k or the default of not limiting the
                automatic unsent buffer size unless you're going to do substantial testing to make
                sure there's not a negative impact for the workload.</p>

                <p>If you decide to use <code>tcp_notsent_lowat</code>, be aware that newer Linux
                kernels (Linux 5.0+ with a further improvement for Linux 5.10+) are recommended to
                substantially reduce system calls / context switches by not triggering the
                application to provide more data until over half the unsent byte buffer is
                empty.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="future">
                <h2><a href="#future">Future</a></h2>

                <p>Ideally, data centers would deploy CAKE throughout their networks with the
                default <code>triple-isolate</code> flow isolation. This may mean they need to use
                more powerful hardware for routing. If the natural bottlenecks used CAKE, setting
                up traffic shaping on the server wouldn't be necessary. This doesn't seem likely
                any time soon. Deploying <code>fq_codel</code> is much more realistic and tackles
                buffer bloat but not the issue of fairness between hosts rather than only
                streams.</p>
