            <h1><a href="#attestation-compatibility-guide">Attestation compatibility guide</a></h1>

            <p>Apps using the Play Integrity API or
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/deprecation-timeline">obsolete</a>
            SafetyNet Attestation API to check the authenticity/integrity of the OS can support
            GrapheneOS by using the standard Android hardware attestation API instead and
            permitting our official release signing keys. Android's
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-key-attestation">hardware
            attestation API</a> provides a much stronger form of attestation than the Play
            Integrity API with the ability to whitelist the keys of alternate operating systems.
            It also avoids an unnecessary dependency on Google Play services and Google's
            Play Integrity servers.</p>

            <p>Devices have been required to ship with hardware attestation support since Android
            8. You can use hardware attestation on devices running Android 8 or later when the
            <code>ro.product.first_api_level</code> system property isn't set to 25 or below,
            which indicates they launched with Android 8 or later with hardware attestation
            support as a mandatory feature. On older devices, you can continue using the Play
            Integrity API. Some low quality devices shipped broken implementations of hardware
            attestation despite the requirement to have it working for CDD/CTS certification and
            the Play Integrity API currently still passes on those devices wrongly claiming them
            to be CTS certified. If you don't want to fail on those devices, then you can start
            with hardware attestation and fall back to the Play Integrity API or do both and
            accept either passing as success.</p>

            <p>Google provides a <a href="https://github.com/google/android-key-attestation">key
            attestation library</a> with examples. Our <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor">MIT
            / Apache 2 licensed Auditor app</a> can be used a reference implementation for
            verifying hardware-based attestations. There are some subtleties in the verification
            process such as making sure only the 2nd certificate in the chain (the one signing the
            certificate for the key generated by your app) has an attestation extension to prevent
            making a fake attestation by extending the chain. You can reuse our code and simply
            omit support for an app generated attestation signing key (attest key) and the other
            pinning support.</p>

            <p>After verifying the signature of the attestation certificate chain and extracting
            the attestation metadata, you can enforce that <code>verifiedBootState</code> is
            either <code>Verified</code> or <code>SelfSigned</code>. For the
            <code>SelfSigned</code> case, you can check that <code>verifiedBootKey</code> matches
            one of the official GrapheneOS verified boot keys. These are the base16-encoded
            verified boot key fingerprints for the official GrapheneOS releases:</p>

            <p>The <code>verifiedBootKey</code> field is binary data so you either need to encode
            it as base16 to compare with these or convert these to binary. An easy approach is
            storing the permitted key fingerprints in a set and enforcing that the verified boot
            key is in the permitted set when <code>verifiedBootState</code> is
            <code>SelfSigned</code>.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS regularly adds support for new devices so you should have a process for
            regularly adding the new verified boot key fingerprints from this page.</p>

            <p>The hardware attestation API also provides other useful information signed by the
            hardware including the OS patch level, in a way that even an attacker exploiting the
            OS after boot to gain root cannot trivially bypass. It's a better feature than the
            Play Integrity API which has to be designed for the lowest common denominator.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS users are strongly encouraged to share this documentation with app
            developers enforcing only being able to use the stock OS. Send an email to the
            developers and leave a review of the app with a link to this information. Share it
            with other users and create pressure to support GrapheneOS rather than locking users
            into the stock OS without a valid security reason. GrapheneOS not only upholds the
            app security model but substantially reinforces it, so it cannot be justified with
            reasoning based on security, anti-fraud, etc.</p>
