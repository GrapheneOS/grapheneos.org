                    <p>Smartphone and tablet targets:</p>

                        <li>barbet (Pixel 5a)</li>
                        <li>redfin (Pixel 5) (extended support)</li>
                        <li>bramble (Pixel 4a (5G)) (extended support)</li>
                        <li>sunfish (Pixel 4a) (legacy extended support)</li>
                        <li>coral (Pixel 4 XL) (legacy extended support)</li>
                        <li>flame (Pixel 4) (legacy extended support)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These are all fully supported production-ready targets supporting all the
                    baseline security features and receiving full monthly security updates
                    covering all firmware, kernel drivers, driver libraries / services and other
                    device-specific code. A fully signed user build for these devices is a proper
                    GrapheneOS release. Newer generation devices have stronger hardware / firmware
                    security and hardware-based OS security features and are better development
                    devices for that reason. It's not possible to work on everything via past
                    generation devices. The best development devices are the Pixel 6 and 7 series.
                    </p>

                    <p>SDK emulator target:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>sdk_phone64_x86_64</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These emulator targets don't receive full monthly security updates, don't
                    provide all of the baseline security features and are intended for development
                    usage.</p>

                    <p><strong>We recommend using the sdk_phone64_x86_64 target in either the
                    userdebug or eng variant for most development work.</strong></p>

                    <p>Providing proper support for a device or generic device family requires providing
                    an up-to-date kernel and device support code including driver libraries, firmware and
                    device SELinux policy extensions. Other than some special cases like the emulator, the
                    generic targets rely on the device support code present on the device. Shipping all of
                    this is necessary for full security updates and is tied to enabling verified boot /
                    attestation. Pixel targets have a lot of device-specific hardening in the AOSP base
                    along with some in GrapheneOS which needs to be ported over too. For example, various
                    security features in the kernel including type-based Control Flow Integrity (CFI) and
                    the shadow call stack are currently specific to the kernels for these devices.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#build-dependencies">Build dependencies</a></h3>

                    <p>Arch Linux, Debian bookworm, Ubuntu 23.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS are the
                    officially supported operating systems for building GrapheneOS.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Set up Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)</summary>

                        <p>To build GrapheneOS, install the required packages:</p>

                        <pre>apt install repo yarnpkg python3-venv zip rsync</pre>

                        <p>Your <code>PATH</code> may not contain directories like
                        <code>/sbin</code>, and many system administration commands will fail. The
                        <code>adevtool</code> from GrapheneOS requires the <code>debugfs</code>
                        binary in <code>/sbin</code>. The simplest workaround is to add these
                        directories to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable (and apply the
                        change to your current shell):</p>

                        <pre>echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc</pre>
                    </details>

                    <p>Dependencies for fetching and verifying the sources:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>repo</li>
                        <li>python3 (for repo)</li>
                        <li>git (both for repo and manual usage)</li>
                        <li>gnupg (for verifying AOSP releases and also used internally by repo for self-update verification)</li>
                        <li>openssh (for verifying GrapheneOS releases)</li>
                        <li>136GiB+ storage for a standard sync with history, 90GiB+ storage for a
                            lightweight sync</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Baseline build dependencies:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>x86_64 Linux build environment</li>
                        <li>32GiB of memory or more. Link-Time Optimization (LTO) creates huge peaks
                            during linking and is mandatory for Control Flow Integrity (CFI). Linking
                            Vanadium (Chromium) and the Linux kernel with LTO + CFI are the most memory
                            demanding tasks.</li>
                        <li>100GiB+ of additional free storage space for a typical build of the entire
                        OS for a multiarch device</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can either obtain <code>repo</code> as a distribution package or the
                    self-updating standalone version from the Android Open Source Project. The
                    self-updating variant avoids dealing with out-of-date distribution packages and
                    depends on GPG to verify updates.</p>

                    <p>The Android Open Source Project build system is designed to provide reliable and
                    reproducible builds. To accomplish this, it provides a prebuilt toolchain and other
                    utilities fulfilling most of the build dependency requirements itself. These prebuilt
                    tools have reproducible builds themselves. It runs the build process within a loose
                    sandbox to avoid accidental dependencies on the host system. The process of moving to
                    a fully self-contained build process with minimal external dependencies is gradual and
                    there are still dependencies that need to be installed on the host system.</p>

                    <p>Additional Android Open Source Project build dependencies not provided by the
                    source tree:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>diff (diffutils)</li>
                        <li>freetype2, fontconfig and any OpenType/TrueType font (such as DejaVu
                            but anything works) for OpenJDK despite it being a headless variant
                            without GUI support</li>

                    <p>Since this is syncing the sources for the entire operating system and application
                    layer, it will use a lot of bandwidth and storage space.</p>

                    <p>You likely want to use the most recent stable tag, not the development branch, even
                    for developing a feature. It's easier to port between stable tags that are known to
                    work properly than dealing with a moving target.</p>

                    <section id="development-branch">

                        <p>The <code>14</code> branch is the main development branch of GrapheneOS.
                        It follows along with the latest stable releases of the Android Open Source
                        Project which currently means the latest monthly release of the
                        <code>android14-qpr3-release</code>. The <code>14</code> branch of
                        GrapheneOS should be used for generic builds including the emulator, porting
                        to other devices and for non-legacy officially supported devices.</p>

                        <p>The <code>14-redfin</code> branch is used for the end-of-life Pixel 4a
                        (5G) and Pixel 5.</p>

                        <p>The <code>13</code> branch is used for the end-of-life Pixel 4a.</p>

                        <p>The <code>13-coral</code> branch is used for the end-of-life Pixel 4
                        and Pixel 4 XL.</p>

                        <p>To sync the <code>14</code> branch:</p>

                        <pre>mkdir grapheneos-14
cd grapheneos-14
repo init -u https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b 14
repo sync -j8</pre>

                        <p>If your network is unreliable and <code>repo sync</code> fails, you can run the
                        <code>repo sync</code> command again to continue from where it was interrupted. It
                        handles connection failures robustly and you shouldn't start over from scratch.</p>

                        being appropriate for generic / other devices in the release notes.</p>

                        <p>The manifest for the latest stable release refers to the revisions in other
                        repositories via commit hashes rather than tag names. This avoids the need to use a
                        script to verify tag signatures across all the repositories, since they simply point
                        to the same commits with the same hashes.</p>

                        <p>Note that the repo command itself takes care of updating itself and uses GPG to
                        verify by default.</p>

                    You don't need to start over to switch between different branches or tags. You may
                    need to run <code>repo init</code> again to continue down the same branch since

                    <p>This section is specific to Pixel devices. The emulator and generic targets don't
                    require extra vendor files.</p>

                    <p>Many of these components are already open source, but not everything is set up to
                    be built by the Android Open Source Project build system. Switching to building these
                    components from source will be an incremental effort. In many cases, the vendor files
                    simply need to be ignored and AOSP will already provide them instead. Firmware cannot
                    generally be built from source even when sources are available, other than to verify
                    that the official builds match the sources, since it has signature verification (which
                    is an important part of the verified boot and attestation security model).</p>

                    non-trivial changes:</p>

                    <pre>rm -r out</pre>

                    <p>Next, start the build process with the <code>m</code> command:</p>

                    <p>For the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6a you currently need <code>m

                    <code>target-files-package</code>.</p>

                    <p>The <code>-j</code> parameter can be passed to <code>m</code> to set a specific

                    sets the number of jobs to <code>NumCPU() + 2</code> where <code>NumCPU()</code> is the

                    <p>The normal production build process involves building a target files package to be
                    resigned with secure release keys and then converted into factory images and/or an
                    update zip via the sections below. If you have a dedicated development device with no
                    security requirements, you can save time by using the default build target rather than
                    target-files-package. Leave the bootloader unlocked and flashing the raw images that
                    are signed with the default public test keys.</p>

                    <p>Technically, you could generate test key signed update packages. However, there's
                    no point of sideloading update packages when the bootloader is unlocked and there's no
                    value in a locked bootloader without signing the build using release keys, since
                    verified boot will be meaningless and the keys used to verify sideloaded updates are
                    also public. The only reason to use update packages or a locked bootloader without
                    signing the build with release keys would be testing that functionality and it makes a
                    lot more sense to test it with proper signing keys rather than the default public test
                    keys.</p>

                    and AES256 as the cipher. If you use swap, make sure it's encrypted, ideally with an
                    ephemeral key rather a persistent key to support hibernation. Even with an ephemeral
                    key, swap will reduce the security gained from encrypting the keys since it breaks the
                    guarantee that they become at rest as soon as the signing process is finished.
                    Consider disabling swap, at least during the signing process.</p>

                    <p>The encryption passphrase for all the keys generated for a device needs to
                    match for compatibility with the GrapheneOS scripts.</p>

                        <p>You can (re-)encrypt your signing keys using the <code>encrypt_keys</code> script,

                        <p>The <code>script/decrypt_keys.sh</code> script can be used to remove encryption,

                        <p>GrapheneOS currently doesn't use out-of-band updates to APEX
                        components, so these are all signed with the OS releasekey and verified
                        boot key to avoid needing many extra pairs of keys. Each APEX needs an APK
                        signing key and verified boot signing key. If you want to ship out-of-band
                        updates to APEX components, you'll need to deal with this and you should
                        make a separate pair of keys for each one.</p>

                        <p>Consult the upstream documentation on generating these keys. It will
                        likely be covered here in the future, especially if non-flattened APEX
                        components become unavoidable.</p>

                    <p>Build and package up the tools needed to generate over-the-air update packages:</p>

                    <pre>script/release.sh raven</pre>

                    <p>The factory images and update package will be in
                    <code>out/release-raven-<var>BUILD_NUMBER</var></code>. The update zip performs a full OS
                    installation so it can be used to update from any previous version. More efficient
                    incremental updates are used for official over-the-air GrapheneOS updates and can be
                    generated by keeping around past signed <code>target_files</code> zips and generating
                    incremental updates from those to the most recent signed <code>target_files</code>
                    zip.</p>

                    <p>See the <a href="/install/">install page</a> for information on how to use the
                    factory images. See the <a href="/usage#updates-sideloading">usage guide section on
                    sideloading updates</a> for information on how to use the update packages.</p>

                    <p>Running <code>script/release.sh</code> also generates channel metadata for the
                    update server. If you configured the Updater client URL and set the build to include
                    it (see the information on <code>OFFICIAL_BUILD</code> above), you can push signed
                    over-the-air updates via the update system. Simply upload the update package to the
                    update server along with the channel metadata for the release channel, and it will be
                    pushed out to the update client. The <code><var>DEVICE</var>-beta</code> and
                    <code><var>DEVICE</var>-stable</code> metadata provide the Beta and Stable release channels used
                    by the update client. The <code><var>DEVICE</var>-testing</code> metadata provides
                    an internal testing channel for the OS developers, which can be temporarily
                    enabled using <code>adb shell setprop sys.update.channel testing</code>. The name is
                    arbitrary and you can also use any other name for internal testing channels.</p>

                    <p>For GrapheneOS itself, the testing channel is used to push out updates to developer
                    devices, followed by a sample future release to test that the release which is about
                    to be pushed out to the Beta channel is able to update to a future release. Once it's
                    tested internally, the release is pushed out to the Beta channel, and finally to the
                    Stable channel after public testing. A similar approach is recommended for derivatives
                    of GrapheneOS.</p>

                        <p>Incremental updates shipping only the changes between two versions can be generated
                        as a much more efficient way of shipping updates than a full update package containing
                        the entire operating system. The GrapheneOS Updater app will automatically use a delta
                        update if one exists for going directly from the currently installed version to the
                        latest release. In order to generate a delta update, the original signed target files
                        package for both the source version and target version are needed. The
                        <code>script/generate_delta.sh</code> script provides a wrapper script for generating
                        delta updates by passing the device, source version build number and target version
                        build number. For example:</p>

                        <pre>script/generate_delta.sh raven 2021102503 2021102613</pre>

                        <p>The script assumes that the releases are organized in the following directory
                        structure:</p>

                        <pre>releases

    └── release-raven-2022050800</pre>

                        <p>Incremental updates are uploaded alongside the update packages and update metadata
                        on the static web server used as an update server. The update client will
                        automatically check for an incremental update and use it if available. No additional
                        metadata is needed to make incremental updates work.</p>

                <p>Like the Android Open Source Project, GrapheneOS contains some code that's built

                    <p>The Linux kernel is built separately using an AOSP kernel build system
                    wrapping the upstream Linux kernel build system. Since it's a separate build
                    system from the rest of the OS, the kernels are built separately. Many of the
                    repositories are shared with the rest of the OS including the repositories
                    providing the prebuilt toolchain for reproducible builds not depending on the
                    tools from the host OS.</p>

                    <p>Vanadium is a hardened fork of Chromium developed by GrapheneOS and used to provide
                    the WebView and <em>optionally</em> the standalone browser app. It tracks the Chromium
                    release cycles along with having additional updates for downstream changes to the
                    privacy and security hardening patches, so it's updated at a different schedule than
                    the monthly Android releases.</p>

                    <p>The browser and the WebView are independent applications built from the Chromium
                    source tree. The GrapheneOS browser build is located at external/vanadium and the
                    WebView is at external/chromium-webview.</p>

                    <p>See <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/android_build_instructions.md">

                    <pre>git clone https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium.git
cd Vanadium
git checkout <var>CORRECT_BRANCH_OR_TAG</var></pre>

                    <p>Generate a signing key for Vanadium if this is the initial build:</p>

                    <pre>keytool -genkey -v -keystore vanadium.keystore -storetype pkcs12 -alias vanadium -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA -validity 10000 -dname "cn=GrapheneOS"</pre>

                    <p>You will be prompted to enter a password which will be requested by the
                    <code>generate-release.sh</code> script for signing releases. You should back up
                    the generated keystore with your other keys.</p>

                    <p>Fetch the Chromium sources:</p>

                    <pre>fetch --nohooks android</pre>

                    <p>Sync to the latest stable release for Android (replace <code><var>VERSION</var></code> with
                    the correct value):</p>

                    <pre>cd src
git fetch --tags
git checkout <var>VERSION</var></pre>

                    <p>Apply the GrapheneOS patches on top of the tagged release:</p>

                    <pre>git am --whitespace=nowarn --keep-non-patch ../patches/*.patch</pre>

                    <p>Sync submodules and obtain build dependencies:</p>

                    <pre>gclient sync -D --with_branch_heads --with_tags --jobs 32</pre>

                    <p>Then, configure the build in the <code>src</code> directory:</p>

                    <pre>gn args out/Default</pre>

                    <p>Copy the GrapheneOS configuration from <code>../args.gn</code> and save/exit the
                    editor. Modify <code>target_cpu</code> as needed if the target is not arm64. For
                    x86_64, the correct value for <code>target_cpu</code> is <code>x64</code>, but note
                    that the Android source tree refers to it as x86_64.</p>

                    <p>You need to set <code>trichrome_certdigest</code> to the correct value for your
                    generated signing key. You can obtain this with the following command:</p>

                    <pre>keytool -export-cert -alias vanadium -keystore vanadium.keystore | sha256sum</pre>

                    <p>Build the components:</p>

                    <p>Sign the apks:</p>

                    <pre>../generate-release.sh out</pre>

                    <p>The apks need to be copied from <code>out/Default/apks/release/*.apk</code>
                    into the Android source tree at
                    <code>external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm64/</code> with arm64
                    substituted with the correct value for other architectures (arm, x86, x86_64).</p>

                    <p>WebView provider apps need to be whitelisted in
                    <code>frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/config_webview_packages.xml</code>. By default,
                    only the Vanadium WebView is whitelisted.</p>

            <article id="update-server">
                <h2><a href="#update-server">Update server</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS uses a static web server as the update server. The release signing
                script generates the necessary metadata alongside the release files. You simply need
                to host these files at the URL configured in
                <code>packages/apps/Updater/res/values/config.xml</code>. See above for details on
                including the Updater app in a release. These are the relevant files:</p>

                <pre><var>DEVICE</var>-ota_update-<var>BUILD_NUMBER</var>.zip
<var>DEVICE</var>-factory-<var>BUILD_NUMBER</var>.zip
<var>DEVICE</var>-factory-<var>BUILD_NUMBER</var>.zip.sig
<var>DEVICE</var>-testing
<var>DEVICE</var>-beta
<var>DEVICE</var>-stable</pre>

                <p>Generally, you should start by uploading the ota_update, factory images and testing
                channel metadata.</p>

                <p>The <code>testing</code> release channel is an example of an internal release
                channel not configurable via the update client GUI. Internal release channels can have
                arbitrary names. You can override the release channel configured in the update client
                via ADB with the following command:</p>

                <pre>adb shell setprop sys.update.channel <var>CHANNEL_NAME</var></pre>

                <p>Replace <code><var>CHANNEL_NAME</var></code> with the name of the release channel, such as
                <code>testing</code>.</p>

                <p>After pushing out and testing the new release via the internal release channel,
                it's recommended to build a sample future release and push that out as another update
                via an internal testing channel. This is important to test that the changes in your
                latest release have not broken the future upgrade path.</p>

                <p>Finally, once the release has gone through internal testing, upload the metadata
                for the beta channel. Once the release has gone through beta testing, upload the
                metadata for the stable channel.</p>

                <p>Delta update packages should simply be uploaded alongside the rest of the releases.
                The update client will check for the presence of a delta update from the current
                version on the device to the newer release in the selected release channel. There is
                no additional metadata to include alongside the delta update package.</p>

            <article id="stable-release-manifest">
                <h2><a href="#stable-release-manifest">Stable release manifest</a></h2>

                <p>Manifests for stable releases are generated with <code>repo manifest -r</code>
                after tagging the release across all the repositories in a temporary branch and
                syncing to it. This provides a manifest referencing the commits by hashes instead of
                just tags to lock in the revisions. This makes verification of the releases simpler,
                since only the manifest tag needs to be verified rather than tags for each
                repository. This also means the whole release can be verified using the GrapheneOS
                signing key despite referencing many upstream repositories that are not forked by the
                GrapheneOS project.</p>

            <article id="standalone-sdk">
                <h2><a href="#standalone-sdk">Standalone SDK</a></h2>

                <p>It can be useful to set up a standalone installation of the SDK separate from
                the Android Open Source Project tree. This is how the prebuilt apps are built, rather
                than using the older branch of the SDK in the OS source tree.</p>

                <p>Android Studio can also be set up to use an existing SDK and will recognize it and use
                it automatically if Android Studio is installed with an SDK installation already
                available and set up in the environment. You'll also likely want a working
                command-line SDK environment even if you do heavily use Android Studio.</p>

                <p>Using the official releases of the SDK is recommended for simplicity, although with
                a lot of effort you can build everything yourself. Distribution packages are generally
                quite out-of-date and should be avoided. To set up a minimal SDK installation at
                <code>~/android/sdk</code> without Android Studio:</p>

                <pre>mkdir -p ~/android/sdk/bootstrap
cd ~/android/sdk/bootstrap
curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip

unzip commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip
cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager 'cmdline-tools;latest' --sdk_root=$HOME/android/sdk
cd ..
rm -r bootstrap</pre>

                <p>Set <code>ANDROID_HOME</code> to point at the SDK installation in your current
                shell and shell profile configuration. You also need to add the
                <code>cmdline-tools</code> binaries to your <code>PATH</code>. For example:</p>

                <pre>export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/android/sdk"
export PATH="$HOME/android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH"</pre>

                <p>Install platform-tools for tools like adb and fastboot:</p>

                <pre>sdkmanager platform-tools</pre>

                <p>Add the <code>platform-tools</code> executables to your <code>PATH</code>:</p>

                <pre>export PATH="$HOME/android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH"</pre>

                <p>For running the Compatibility Test Suite you'll also need the build-tools for
                aapt:</p>

                <pre>sdkmanager 'build-tools;33.0.2'</pre>

                <p>Add the <code>build-tools</code> executables to your <code>PATH</code>:</p>

                <pre>export PATH="$HOME/android/sdk/build-tools/33.0.2:$PATH"</pre>

                <p>For working with native code, you need the NDK:</p>

                <pre>sdkmanager ndk-bundle</pre>

                <p>Add the <code>ndk-bundle</code> executables to your <code>PATH</code>:</p>

                <pre>export PATH="$HOME/android/sdk/ndk-bundle:$PATH"</pre>

                <p>You should update the sdk before use from this point onwards:</p>

                <pre>sdkmanager --update</pre>

                        <h4><a href="#compatibility-test-suite-setup">Setup</a></h4>
                        <p>You'll need a device attached to your computer with ADB enabled along with the
                        Android SDK installed. The build-tools and platform-tools packages need to be
                        installed and the binaries need to be added to your PATH. See the
                        <a href="#standalone-sdk">standalone SDK installation instructions</a> above.</p>

                        <p>Copy media onto the device:</p>
                        <pre>cd android-cts-media-1.5
./copy_images.sh
./copy_media.sh</pre>

                        <p>You also need to do some basic setup for the device. It's possible for changes from
                        a baseline install to cause interference, so it can be a good idea to factory reset
                        the device if assorted changes have been made. The device needs to be running a user
                        build for the security model to be fully intact in order to pass all the security
                        tests. A userdebug build is expected to fail some of the tests. GrapheneOS also makes
                        various changes intentionally deviating from the requirements expected by the CTS, so
                        there will always be some expected failures. A few of the tests are also known to be
                        quite flaky or broken even with the stock OS and/or AOSP. These will be documented
                        here at some point.</p>

            <article id="obtaining-upstream-manifests">
                <h2><a href="#obtaining-upstream-manifests">Obtaining upstream manifests</a></h2>

                <p>The Android Open Source Project has branches and/or tags for the releases of many
                different components. There are tags and/or branches for the OS, device kernels,
                mainline components (APEX), the NDK, Android Studio, the platform-tools distribution
                packages, the CTS, androidx components, etc. You should obtain the sources via
                manifests using the repo tool, either using the manifest for a tag / branch in
                platform/manifest.git or a manifest provided elsewhere. Different projects use
                different subsets of the repositories. Many of the repositories only exist as an
                archive for older releases and aren't referenced in current manifests.</p>

                <p>Some components don't have the infrastructure set up to generate and push their own
                branches and tags to AOSP. In other cases, it's simply not obvious to an outsider
                which one should be used. As long as the component is built on the standard Android
                project CI infrastructure, it's possible to obtain the manifests to build it based on
                the build number, which is generally incorporated into the build. For example, even
                without a platform-tools tag, you can obtain the build number from <code>adb
                version</code> or <code>fastboot version</code>. Their version output uses the format
                <code><var>VERSION</var>-<var>BUILD_NUMBER</var></code> such as <code>30.0.3-6597393</code> for the
                version <code>30.0.3</code> where the official release had the build number
                <code>6597393</code>. You can obtain the manifest properties with the appropriate
                repository revisions from ci.android.com with a URL like this:
                <a href="https://ci.android.com/builds/submitted/6597393/sdk/latest/view/repo.prop">
                https://ci.android.com/builds/submitted/6597393/sdk/latest/view/repo.prop</a></p>

                <p>The platform-tools tags exist because the GrapheneOS project requested them. The
                same could be done for other projects, but it's not strictly necessarily as long as
                it's possible to obtain the build number to request the information from the Android
                project CI server.</p>

                <p>As another kind of example, <code>prebuilts/clang</code>,
                <code>prebuilts/build-tools</code>, etc. have a manifest file committed alongside the
                prebuilts. Other AOSP toolchain prebuilts reference a build number.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#programming-languages">Programming languages</a></h3>

                    <p>The following programming languages are acceptable for <strong>completely
                        new</strong> GrapheneOS projects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kotlin for apps and any services closely tied to the apps, now that it's not
                            only officially supported by the Android SDK and Android Studio but also the
                            default language with Kotlin exclusive enhancements to the APIs</li>
                        <li>Web applications must be entirely static HTML/CSS/JavaScript. TypeScript would
                            make sense at a larger scale but there are no plans for any large web
                            applications.</li>
                        <li>Rust with <code>no_std</code> for low-level code used in a hypervisor, kernel,
                            daemon, system library, etc. Keep in mind that low-level code is to be avoided
                            whenever a higher-level language is better suited to the job. In general,
                            the project aims to avoid creating more low-level code manually dealing with
                            memory ownership and lifetimes in the first place.</li>
                        <li>C in rare cases for very small and particularly low-level projects without
                            opportunities to reduce the trusted computing base for memory corruption to
                            any significant degree with Rust, such as for the hardened_malloc project</li>
                        <li>arm64 assembly in extremely rare cases where C or Rust aren't usable with
                            compiler intrinsics</li>
                        <li>Python 3 for small (less than 500 lines) development-related scripts that are
                            not exposed to untrusted input. It's never acceptable to use it for
                            client-side code on devices or for servers. It isn't used on the servers even
                            for non-application-server code.</li>
                        <li>Bash for tiny (less than 200 lines) build scripts without any non-trivial
                            logic where Python would be an annoyance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Much of the work is done on existing projects, and the existing languages should be
                    used unless there are already clear stable API boundaries where a different language
                    could be used without causing a substantial maintenance burden. The following
                    languages are typical from most to least common: Java, C++, C, JavaScript, arm64
                    assembly, POSIX shell, Bash.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="code-style">
                    <h3><a href="#code-style">Code style</a></h3>

                    <p>For existing projects, use the official upstream code style. Avoid using legacy
                    conventions that they're moving away from themselves. Follow the code style they use
                    for new additions. Some projects have different code styles for different directories
                    or files depending on their sources, in which case respect the per-file style.</p>

                    <p>For new projects, follow the official code style for the language. Treat the
                    standard library APIs as defining the naming style for usage of the language, i.e. C
                    uses <code>variable_or_function_name</code>, <code>type_name</code>,
                    <code>MACRO_NAME</code> while JavaScript uses <code>variable_or_function_name</code>,
                    <code>ClassName</code> and <code>CONSTANT_NAME</code>. For Python, follow PEP8 and the
                    same goes for other languages with official styles whether defined in a document or by
                    the default mode for the official formatting tool like <code>rustfmt</code>.</p>

                    <p>For cases where there isn't an official or prevailing code style for other things,
                    avoid tabs, use 4-space indents, <code>function_name</code>,
                    <code>variable_name</code>, <code>TypeName</code> and <code>CONSTANT_NAME</code>.
                    Prefer single-line comment syntax other than rare cases where it makes sense to add a
                    tiny comment within a line of code. In languages with the optional braces misfeature
                    (C, C++, Java), always use them. Open braces on the same line as function definitions
                    / statements. Wrap lines at 100 columns except in rare cases where it would be far
                    uglier to wrap the line.</p>

                    <p>For JavaScript, all code should be contained within ES6 modules. This means every
                    script element should use <code>type="module"</code>. Modules provide proper
                    namespacing with explicit imports and exports. Modules automatically use strict mode,
                    so <code>"use strict";</code> is no longer needed. By default, modules are also
                    deferred until after the DOM is ready, i.e. they have an implicit <code>defer</code>
                    attribute. This should be relied upon rather than unnecessarily listening for an event
                    to determine if the DOM is ready for use. It can make sense to use <code>async</code>
                    to run the code earlier if the JavaScript is essential to the content and benefits
                    from being able to start tasks before the DOM is ready, such as retrieving important
                    content or checking if there's a login session. Always end lines with semicolons
                    (since automatic insertion is poorly designed) and always use <code>const</code> to
                    declare variables, unless they are reassigned in which case they should be declared
                    with <code>let</code> but never use <code>var</code> as it is effectively broken. Try
                    to prefer loops with <code>for..of</code>. JavaScript must pass verification with
                    <code>eslint</code> using the following <code>eslint.config.js</code> configuration:</p>

                    <pre>import js from "@eslint/js";
import globals from "globals";

export default [
    js.configs.recommended,
    {
        languageOptions: {
            globals: {
                ...globals.browser
            },
            ecmaVersion: 2022,
            sourceType: "module"
        },
        rules: {
            indent: ["error", 4],
            "linebreak-style": ["error", "unix"],
            quotes: ["error", "double"],
            semi: ["error", "always"],
            "no-unused-vars": ["error", {caughtErrors: "none"}],
            "no-var": ["error"]
        }
    }
];</pre>

                    <p>Cookies are only used for login sessions. Every cookie must have the
                    <code>__Host</code> prefix to guarantee that it has the <code>Secure</code>
                    attribute and <code>Path=/</code>. The <code>HttpOnly</code> and
                    <code>SameSite=Strict</code> flags should also always be included. These kinds
                    of cookies can provide secure login sessions in browsers with fully working
                    <code>SameSite=Strict</code> support.</p>

                    <p>CSRF mitigation should be implemented via enforcing the presence of
                    Sec-Fetch-Site with the value same-origin. Services using only POST can also do
                    this via the more backwards compatible Origin header.</p>

                    <p>For web content, use dashes as user-facing word separators rather than underscores.
                    Page titles should follow the scheme "Page | Directory | Higher-level directory |
                    Site" for usability with a traditional title as the Open Graph title.</p>

                    <p>HTML must pass verification with <code>validatornu</code> and <code>xmllint</code>.
                    Ensuring that it parses as XML with <code>xmllint</code> catches many common mistakes
                    and typos that are missed by HTML validation due to the ridiculously permissive nature
                    of HTML. This enforces closing every tag, using proper escaping and so on. XHTML does
                    not really exist anymore and we simply use XML parsing as an enforced coding standard
                    and lint pass. It can also be useful to make it compatible with XML-based tooling.</p>

                    <p>Avoid designing around class inheritance unless it's a rare case where it's an
                    extremely good fit or the language sucks (Java) and it's the least bad approach, but
                    still try to avoid it.</p>

                    <p>Use concise but self-explanatory variable names. Prefer communicating information
                    via naming rather than using comments whenever possible. Don't name variables
                    <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, etc. like C programmers. It's okay to
                    use things like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for parameters if the function is
                    genuinely that generic and operates on arbitrary values. In general, try to scope
                    variables into the most limited scope (in C or C++, be careful about this when
                    references are taken).</p>

                    <p>Write code that's clean and self-explanatory. Use comments to explain or justify
                    non-obvious things, but try to avoid needing them in the first place. In most cases,
                    they should just be communicating non-local information such as explaining why an
                    invariant is true based on the code elsewhere (consider a runtime check to make sure
                    it's true, or an assertion if performance would be an issue). Docstrings at the top of
                    top-level functions, modules, etc. are a different story and shouldn't be avoided.</p>

                    <p>Make extensive usage of well designed standard library modules. For apps, treat
                    Jetpack (androidx) as part of the standard library and make good use of it. For Java,
                    Guava can also be treated as part of the standard library.</p>

                    <p>Libraries outside of the standard library should be used very cautiously. They
                    should be well maintained, stable, well tested and widely used. Libraries implemented
                    with memory unsafe languages should generally be avoided (one exception: SQLite).</p>

                    <p>Generally, frameworks and libraries existing solely to provide different paradigms
                    and coding patterns are to be avoided. They increase barrier to entry for developers,
                    generally only increase complexity unless used at very large scales (and may not even
                    make things simpler in those cases) and come and go as fads. This is only okay when
                    it's part of the standard libraries or libraries that are considered standard
                    (androidx, Guava) by GrapheneOS and should still be approached cautiously. Only use it
                    if it truly makes the correct approach simpler. Ignore fads and figure out if it
                    actually makes sense to use, otherwise just stick to the old fashioned way if the
                    fancy alternatives aren't genuinely better.</p>
