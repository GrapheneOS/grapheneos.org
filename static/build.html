                <a href="#build-targets">Build targets</a>
            </h2>

            <p>Smartphone targets:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>aosp_marlin (Pixel XL)</li>
                <li>aosp_sailfish (Pixel)</li>
                <li>aosp_taimen (Pixel 2 XL)</li>
                <li>aosp_walleye (Pixel 2)</li>
                <li>aosp_crosshatch (Pixel 3 XL)</li>
                <li>aosp_blueline (Pixel 3)</li>
                <li>aosp_bonito (Pixel 3a XL)</li>
                <li>aosp_sargo (Pixel 3a)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are all fully supported production-ready targets supporting all the baseline
            security features and receiving full monthly security updates covering all firmware,
            kernel drivers, driver libraries / services and other device-specific code. A fully
            signed user build for these devices is a proper GrapheneOS release. Newer generation
            devices have stronger hardware / firmware security and hardware-based OS security
            features and are better development devices for that reason. It's not possible to work
            on everything via past generation devices. The best development devices are the Pixel
            3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL.</p>

            <p>Generic targets:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>aosp_arm</li>
                <li>aosp_arm64</li>
                <li>aosp_mips</li>
                <li>aosp_mips64</li>
                <li>aosp_x86</li>
                <li>aosp_x86_64</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These generic targets can be used with the emulator along with many smartphones,
            tablets and other devices. These targets don't receive full monthly security updates,
            don't offer all of the baseline security features and are intended for development
            usage.</p>

            <p>Providing proper support for a device or generic device family requires providing
            an up-to-date kernel and device support code including driver libraries, firmware and
            device SELinux policy extensions. Other than some special cases like the emulator, the
            generic targets rely on the device support code present on the device. Shipping all of
            this is necessary for full security updates and is tied to enabling verified boot /
            attestation. Pixel targets have a lot of device-specific hardening in the AOSP base
            along with some in GrapheneOS which needs to be ported over too. For example, various
            security features in the kernel including type-based Control Flow Integrity (CFI) and
            the shadow call stack are currently specific to the kernels for these devices.</p>

            <p>SDK emulator targets:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>sdk_phone_armv7</li>
                <li>sdk_phone_arm64</li>
                <li>sdk_phone_mips</li>
                <li>sdk_phone_mips64</li>
                <li>sdk_phone_x86</li>
                <li>sdk_phone_x86_64</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are extended versions of the generic targets with extra components for the
            SDK. These targets don't receive full monthly security updates, don't provide all of
            the baseline security features and are intended for development usage.</p>

            <p>Board targets:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hikey</li>
                <li>hikey960</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The hikey and hikey960 targets are not actively tested and have unresolved upstream
            memory corruption bugs uncovered by GrapheneOS security features. It boots, but there
            are major issues with the graphics drivers among other problems. The intention is to
            support them, but the necessary time has not yet been dedicated to it. These targets
            don't receive full monthly security updates, don't provide all of the baseline
            security features and are intended for development usage.</p>

            <p>Since this is syncing the sources for the entire operating system and application
            layer, it will use a lot of bandwidth and storage space.</p>

            <p>You likely want to use the most recent stable tag, not the development branch, even
            for developing a feature. It's easier to port between stable tags that are known to
            work properly than dealing with a moving target.</p>

            <h2 id="development-branch">
                <a href="#development-branch">Development branch</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The <code>10</code> branch is the only active development branch for GrapheneOS
            development. Older branches are no longer maintained. It is currently used for all
            officially supported devices and should be used for the basis of ports to other
            devices. Occasionally, some devices may be supported through device support branches
            to avoid impacting other devices with changes needed to support them.</p>

            <pre>mkdir grapheneos-10
cd grapheneos-10
repo init -u https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b 10
repo sync -j32</pre>

            <p>If your network is unreliable and <code>repo sync</code> fails, you can run the
            <code>repo sync</code> command again as many times as needed for it to fully
            succeed.</p>

            <h2 id="stable-release">
                <a href="#stable-release">Stable release</a>
            </h2>

            <p>Pick a specific build for a device from the <a href="/releases">releases page</a>
            and download the source tree. Note that some devices use different Android Open Source
            Project branches so they can end up with different tags. Make sure to use the correct
            tag for a device. For devices without official support, use the latest tag for the
            Pixel 3.</p>

            <pre>mkdir grapheneos-TAG_NAME
cd grapheneos-TAG_NAME
repo init -u https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b refs/tags/TAG_NAME</pre>

            <p>Verify the manifest:</p>

            <p>Verify the source tree:</p>

            <pre>repo forall -c 'git verify-tag --raw $(git describe)' || echo Verification failed!</pre>

            <p>These instructions will be extended in the future to check the verify-tag
            output.</p>

            <p>Note that the repo command itself takes care of updating itself and uses gpg to
            verify by default.</p>

                <a href="#updating-and-switching-branches-or-tags">Updating and switching branches or tags</a>
            </h2>

            <p>To update the source tree, run the <code>repo init</code> command again to select
            the branch or tag and then run <code>repo sync -j32</code> again. You may need to add
            <code>--force-sync</code> if a repository switched from one source to another,
            such as when GrapheneOS forks an additional Android Open Source Project repository.
            You don't need to start over to switch between different branches or tags. You may
            need to run <code>repo init</code> again to continue down the same branch since
            GrapheneOS only provides a stable history via tags.</p>

            <h2 id="kernel">
                <a href="#kernel">Kernel</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The kernel needs to be built in advance, since it uses a separate build system.</p>

            <p>List of kernels corresponding to officially supported devices:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pixel, Pixel XL: marlin - shared build</li>
                <li>Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL: wahoo - separate taimen and walleye builds due to hardening</li>
                <li>Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL: crosshatch - separate crosshatch, blueline and bonito builds due to hardening</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As part of the hardening in GrapheneOS, it uses fully monolithic kernel builds with
            dynamic kernel modules disabled. This improves the effectiveness of mitigations like
            Control Flow Integrity benefiting from whole program analysis. It also reduces attack
            surface and complexity including making the build system simpler. The kernel trees
            marked as using a separate build above need to have the device variant passed to the
            GrapheneOS kernel build script to select the device.</p>

            <p>For the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, the kernel repository uses
            submodules for building in out-of-tree modules. You need to make sure the submodule
            sources are updated before building. In the future, this should end up being handled
            automatically by <code>repo</code>. There's no harm in running the submodule commands
            for other devices as they will simply not do anything.</p>

            <p>For example, to build the kernel for blueline:</p>

            <pre>cd kernel/google/crosshatch
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init
./build.sh blueline</pre>

            <p>The <code>kernel/google/marlin</code> repository is for the Pixel and Pixel XL, the
            <code>kernel/google/wahoo</code> repository is for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL and the
            <code>kernel/google/crosshatch</code> repository is for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3
            XL.</p>

            <p><em>For the first generation Pixel (sailfish) and Pixel XL (marlin), signed
            releases require building the verity public key into the kernel so the keys need to be
            generated per the instructions below before building the kernel.</em></p>

                <a href="#setting-up-the-os-build-environment">Setting up the OS build environment</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The build has to be done from bash as envsetup.sh is not compatible with other
            shells like zsh.</p>

            <p>Set up the build environment:</p>

            <pre>source script/envsetup.sh</pre>

            <p>Select the desired build target (<code>aosp_crosshatch</code> is the Pixel 3 XL):

            <pre>choosecombo release aosp_crosshatch user</pre>

            <p>For a development build, you may want to replace <code>user</code> with
            <code>userdebug</code> in order to have better debugging support. Production builds
            should be <code>user</code> builds as they are significantly more secure and don't
            make additional performance sacrifices to improve debugging.</p>

            <p>To reproduce a past build, you need to export <code>BUILD_DATETIME</code> and
            <code>BUILD_NUMBER</code> to the values set for the past build. These can be obtained
            from <code>out/build_date.txt</code> and <code>out/build_number.txt</code> in a build
            output directory and the <code>ro.build.date.utc</code> and
            <code>ro.build.version.incremental</code> properties which are also included in the
            over-the-air zip metadata rather than just the OS itself.</p>

            <p>The signing process for release builds is done after completing builds and replaces
            the dm-verity trees, apk signatures, etc. and can only be reproduced with access to
            the same private keys. If you want to compare to production builds signed with
            different keys you need to stick to comparing everything other than the
            signatures.</p>

            <p>This section does not apply to devices where no extra vendor files are required (HiKey, HiKey 960, emulator, generic targets).</p>

            <p>Many of these components are already open source, but not everything is set up to
            be built by the Android Open Source Project build system. Switching to building these
            components from source will be an incremental effort. In many cases, the vendor files
            simply need to be ignored and AOSP will already provide them instead. Firmware cannot
            generally be built from source even when sources are available, other than to verify
            that the official builds match the sources, since it has signature verification (which
            is an important part of the verified boot and attestation security model).</p>

            <p>Extract the vendor files corresponding to the matching release:</p>

            </h2>

            <p>Incremental builds (i.e. starting from the old build) usually work for development
            and are the normal way to develop changes. However, there are cases where changes are
            not properly picked up by the build system. For production builds, you should remove
            the remnants of any past builds before starting, particularly if there were
            non-trivial changes:</p>

            <pre>rm -r out</pre>

            <p>Start the build process, with -j# used to set the number of parallel jobs to the
            number of CPU threads. You also need 2-4GiB of memory per job, so reduce it based on
            available memory if necessary:</p>

            <pre>make target-files-package -j20</pre>

            <p><strong>For an emulator build, always use the development build approach below.</strong></p>

                <a href="#faster-builds-for-development-use-only">Faster builds for development use only</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The normal production build process involves building a target files package to be
            resigned with secure release keys and then converted into factory images and/or an
            update zip via the sections below. If you have a dedicated development device with no
            security requirements, you can save time by using the default make target, leaving the
            bootloader unlocked and flashing the raw images that are signed with the default
            public test keys:</p>

            <pre>make -j20</pre>

            <p>Technically, you could generate test key signed update packages. However, there's
            no point of sideloading update packages when the bootloader is unlocked and there's no
            value in a locked bootloader without signing the build using release keys, since
            verified boot will be meaningless and the keys used to verify sideloaded updates are
            also public. The only reason to use update packages or a locked bootloader without
            signing the build with release keys would be testing that functionality and it makes a
            lot more sense to test it with proper signing keys rather than the default public test
            keys.</p>

            </h2>

            <p>Keys need to be generated for resigning completed builds from the publicly
            available test keys.  The keys must then be reused for subsequent builds and cannot be
            changed without flashing the generated factory images again which will perform a
            factory reset. Note that the keys are used for a lot more than simply verifying
            updates and verified boot.</p>

            <p>The keys should not be given passwords due to limitations in the upstream scripts.
            If you want to secure them at rest, you should take a different approach where they
            can still be available to the signing scripts as a directory of unencrypted keys. The
            sample certificate subject can be replaced with your own information or simply left
            as-is.</p>

            <p>The Pixel and Pixel XL use Android Verified Boot 1.0. The Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL,
            Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL use Android Verified Boot 2.0 (AVB).

            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS disables updatable APEX components for the officially supported devices
            and targets inheriting from the mainline target, so APEX signing keys are not needed
            and this section can be ignored for unmodified builds.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS uses the <code>TARGET_FLATTEN_APEX := true</code> format to include APEX
            components as part of the base OS without supporting out-of-band updates.</p>

            <p><strong>If you don't disable updatable APEX packages, you need to generate an APK and
            AVB key for each APEX component and extend the GrapheneOS release.sh script to pass
            the appropriate parameters to replace the APK and AVB keys for each APEX
            component.</strong></p>

            <p>APEX components that are not flattened are a signed APK (used to verify updates)
            with an embedded filesystem image signed with an AVB key (for verified boot). Each
            APEX package must have a unique set of keys. GrapheneOS has no use for these
            out-of-band updates at this time and flattening APEX components avoids needing a bunch
            of extra keys and complexity.</p>

            <p>For now, consult the upstream documentation on generating these keys. It will be
            covered here in the future.</p>

            <p>The factory images and update package will be in
            <code>out/release-crosshatch-$BUILD_NUMBER</code>. The update zip performs a full OS
            installation so it can be used to update from any previous version. More efficient
            incremental updates are used for official over-the-air GrapheneOS updates and can be
            generated by keeping around past signed <code>target_files</code> zips and generating
            incremental updates from those to the most recent signed <code>target_files</code>
            zip.</p>

            <p>Incremental updates shipping only the changes between two versions can be generated
            as a much more efficient way of shipping updates than a full update package containing
            the entire operating system. The GrapheneOS Updater app will automatically use a delta
            update if one exists for going directly from the currently installed version to the
            latest release. In order to generate a delta update, the original signed target files
            package for both the source version and target version are needed. The
            <code>script/generate_delta.sh</code> script provides a wrapper script for generating
            delta updates by passing the device, source version build number and target version
            build number. For example:</p>

            <pre>script/generate_delta.sh crosshatch 2019.09.25.00 2019.10.07.21</pre>

            <p>The script assumes that the releases are organized in the following directory
            structure:</p>

            Like the Android Open Source Project, GrapheneOS contains some code that's built
            separately and then bundled into the source tree as binaries. This section will be
            gradually expanded to cover building all of it.

            <h3 id="browser-and-webview">
                <a href="#browser-and-webview">Browser and WebView</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Vanadium is a hardened fork of Chromium developed by GrapheneOS and used to provide
            the WebView and <em>optionally</em> the standalone browser app. It tracks the Chromium
            release cycles along with having additional updates for downstream changes to the
            privacy and security hardening patches, so it's updated at a different schedule than
            the monthly Android releases.</p>

            <p>The browser and the WebView are independent applications built from the Chromium
            source tree. The GrapheneOS browser build is located at external/vanadium and the
            WebView is at external/chromium-webview.</p>

            <p>See <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_build_instructions.md">
            Chromium's Android build instructions</a> for details on obtaining the
            prerequisites.</p>

            <p>You can obtain the proper configuration from the
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium">
            GrapheneOS Vanadium repository</a> in <code>args.gn</code> including the correct
            version.</p>

            <pre>git clone https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium.git
cd Vanadium
git checkout $CORRECT_BRANCH_OR_TAG</pre>

            <p>Fetch the Chromium sources:</p>

            <pre>fetch --nohooks android</pre>

            <p>Sync to the latest stable release for Android (replace $VERSION with the correct
            value):</p>

            <pre>gclient sync -D --with_branch_heads -r $VERSION --jobs 32</pre>

            <p>Apply the GrapheneOS patches on top of the tagged release:</p>

            <pre>cd src
git am --whitespace=nowarn ../*.patch</pre>

            <p>Generate a signing key for Vanadium if this is the initial build (the sample
            password configured in args.gn is <code>vanadiumpass</code>):</p>

            <pre>keytool -genkey -v -keystore vanadium.keystore -alias vanadiumkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -sigalg SHA512withRSA -validity 10000 -dname "cn=GrapheneOS"</pre>

            <p>You should back this up with your other keys.</p>

            <p>Then, configure the build in the <code>src</code> directory:</p>

            <pre>gn args out/Default</pre>

            <p>Copy the GrapheneOS configuration from <code>../args.gn</code> and save/exit the
            editor. Modify <code>target_cpu</code> as needed if the target is not arm64. For
            x86_64, the correct value for <code>target_cpu</code> is <code>x64</code>, but note
            that the Android source tree refers to it as x86_64.</p>

            <p>To build ChromeModernPublic, which provides the browser app:</p>

            <pre>ninja -C out/Default/ chrome_modern_public_apk</pre>

            <p>The apk needs to be copied from <code>out/Default/apks/ChromeModernPublic.apk</code>
            into the Android source tree at
            <code>external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm64/ChromeModernPublic.apk</code> with arm64
            substituted with the correct value for other architectures (arm, x86, x86_64).</p>

            <p>To build SystemWebView, which provides the WebView:</p>

            <pre>ninja -C out/Default/ system_webview_apk</pre>

            <p>The apk needs to be copied from <code>out/Default/apks/SystemWebView.apk</code>

            <code>external/chromium-webview/prebuilt/arm64/webview.apk</code> with arm64
            substituted with the correct value for other architectures (arm, x86, x86_64).</p>

            <p><strong>Vanadium cannot yet provide the WebView for Android 10. The changes for
            this have not yet landed upstream for the current stable release. It either needs to
            be addressed upstream or downstream in order for this to work again.</strong></p>

            <p>WebView provider apps need to be whitelisted in

            <p>The official releases of the Auditor and PdfViewer apps are bundled as an apk into
            external/ repositories. There are no modifications to these for GrapheneOS. These are
            built and signed with the standard <code>gradle</code> Android plugin build
            system.</p>

                <a href="#standalone-sdk">Standalone SDK</a>
            </h2>

            <p>It can be useful to set up a standalone installation of the SDK separate from
            the Android Open Source Project tree. This is how the prebuilt apps are built, rather
            than using the older branch of the SDK in the OS source tree.</p>

            <p>Android Studio can also be set up to use an existing SDK and will recognize it and use
            it automatically if Android Studio is installed with an SDK installation already
            available and set up in the environment. You'll also likely want a working
            command-line SDK environment even if you do heavily use Android Studio.</p>

            <p>Using the official releases of the SDK is recommended for simplicity, although with
            a lot of effort you can build everything yourself. Distribution packages are generally
            quite out-of-date and should be avoided. To set up a minimal SDK installation without
            Android Studio on Linux:</p>

            <pre>mkdir ~/sdk
cd ~/sdk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
unzip sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
rm sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip</pre>

            <p>Add the directories to your PATH in your shell profile configuration and do the
            same in your current shell:</p>

            <pre>export PATH="$HOME/sdk/tools:$HOME/sdk/tools/bin:$HOME/sdk/platform-tools:$HOME/sdk/build-tools/29.0.2:$PATH:$HOME/sdk/ndk-bundle"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/sdk"</pre>

            <p>Run an initial update:</p>

            <pre>sdkmanager --update</pre>

            <p>Install platform-tools for tools like adb and fastboot:</p>

            <pre>sdkmanager platform-tools</pre>

            <p>For running the Compatibility Test Suite you'll also need the build-tools for
            aapt:</p>

            <pre>sdkmanager 'build-tools;29.0.2'</pre>

            <p>For working with native code, you need the NDK:</p>

            <pre>sdkmanager ndk-bundle</pre>

            <p>You should update the sdk before use from this point onwards:</p>

            <pre>sdkmanager --update</pre>

            rather than only the current very minimal coverage of the Compatibility Test Suite
            (CTS).</p>

            </h3>

            <p>To test a build for the emulator, run <code>emulator</code> within the build
            environment. The emulator will use CPU hardware acceleration via KVM along with
            optional graphics acceleration via the host GPU if these are available.</p>

            </h4>

            <p>Testing with the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) can be done by either building the
            test suite from source or using the official releases.</p>
            <p>Official releases of the CTS can be downloaded from
            <a href="https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/downloads">the Compatibility
            Suite Downloads page</a>. You should download the CTS for the relevant release
            (Android 9) and architecture (ARM). There's a separate zip for the main CTS, the
            manual portion (CTS Verifier) and the CTS for Instant Apps. The latest release of the
            CTS Media Files also needs to be downloaded from that section.</p>

            <h4 id="compatibility-test-suite-setup">
                <a href="#compatibility-test-suite-setup">Setup</a>
            </h4>
            <p>You'll need a device attached to your computer with ADB enabled along with the
            Android SDK installed. The build-tools and platform-tools packages need to be
            installed and the binaries need to be added to your PATH. For example, with the SDK
            located at <code>/home/username</code>:</p>
            <pre>export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/sdk"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/sdk/tools:$HOME/sdk/tools/bin:$HOME/sdk/platform-tools:$HOME/sdk/build-tools/29.0.2:$HOME/sdk/ndk-bundle"</pre>
            <p>Copy media onto the device:</p>
            <pre>cd android-cts-media-1.4
./copy_images.sh
./copy_media.sh</pre>

            <p>You also need to do some basic setup for the device. It's possible for changes from
            a baseline install to cause interference, so it can be a good idea to factory reset
            the device if assorted changes have been made. The device needs to be running a user
            build for the security model to be fully intact in order to pass all the security
            tests. A userdebug build is expected to fail some of the tests. GrapheneOS also makes
            various changes intentionally deviating from the requirements expected by the CTS, so
            there will always be some expected failures. A few of the tests are also known to be
            quite flaky or broken even with the stock OS and/or AOSP. These will be documented
            here at some point.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Must be connected to a WiFi network with IPv6 internet access</li>
                <li>Must have a working SIM card with mobile data with IPv6 internet access</li>
                <li>Disable SIM lock</li>
                <li>Enable Bluetooth</li>
                <li>Enable NFC and NDEF (Android Beam)</li>
                <li>Open / close Chromium to deal with initial setup</li>
                <li>Prop up with a good object to focus on and good lighting for Camera tests</li>
                <li>Bluetooth beacons for Bluetooth tests</li>
                <li>Must have a great GPS/GNSS signal for location tests</li>
                <li>SIM card with carrier privilege rules</li>
                <li>Secure element applet installed on the embedded secure element or SIM
                    card</li>
                <li>At least one Wi-Fi RTT access point powered up but not connected to any
                    network</li>
                <li>The screen lock must be disabled.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="compatibility-test-suite-run-modules">
                <a href="#compatibility-test-suite-run-modules">Run modules</a>
            </h4>

            <p>Run the test harness:</p>
            <pre>./android-cts/tools/cts-tradefed</pre>
            <p>Note that <code>_JAVA_OPTIONS</code> being set will break the version detection.</p>
            <p>To obtain a list of CTS modules:</p>
            <pre>list modules</pre>
            <p>To run a specific module and avoid wasting time capturing device information:</p>
            <pre>run cts --skip-device-info --module CtsModuleName</pre>
            <p>To speed up initialization after running some initial tests:</p>
            <pre>run cts --skip-device-info --skip-preconditions --module CtsModuleName</pre>
            <p>It's possible to run the whole standard CTS plan with a single command, but running
            specific modules is recommended, especially if you don't have everything set up for
            the entire test suite.</p>

            <h3 id="programming-languages">
                <a href="#programming-languages">Programming languages</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The following programming languages are acceptable for <strong>completely
                new</strong> GrapheneOS projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kotlin for apps and any services closely tied to the apps, now that it's not
                    only officially supported by the Android SDK and Android Studio but also the
                    default language with Kotlin exclusive enhancements to the APIs</li>
                <li>Web applications must be entirely static HTML/CSS/JavaScript. TypeScript would
                    make sense at a larger scale but there are no plans for any large web
                    applications.</li>
                <li>Rust with <code>no_std</code> for low-level code used in a hypervisor, kernel,
                    daemon, system library, etc. Keep in mind that low-level code is to be avoided
                    whenever a higher language language is better suited to the job. In general,
                    the project aims to avoid creating more low-level code manually dealing with
                    memory ownership and lifetimes in the first place.</li>
                <li>C in rare cases for very small and particularly low-level projects without
                    opportunities to reduce the trusted computing base for memory corruption to
                    any significant degree with Rust, such as for the hardened_malloc project</li>
                <li>arm64 assembly in extremely rare cases where C or Rust aren't usable with
                    compiler intrinsics</li>
                <li>Python 3 for small (less than 500 lines) development-related scripts that are
                    not exposed to untrusted input. It's never acceptable to use it for
                    client-side code on devices or for servers. It isn't used on the servers even
                    for non-application-server code.</li>
                <li>Bash for tiny (less than 200 lines) build scripts without any non-trivial
                    logic where Python would be an annoyance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Much of the work is done on existing projects, and the existing languages should be
            used unless there are already clear stable API boundaries where a different language
            could be used without causing a substantial maintenance burden. The following
            languages are typical from most to least common: Java, C++, C, JavaScript, arm64
            assembly, POSIX shell, Bash.</p>

            <h3 id="code-style">
                <a href="#code-style">Code style</a>
            </h3>

            <p>For existing projects, use the official upstream code style. Avoid using legacy
            conventions that they're moving away from themselves. Follow the code style they use
            for new additions. Some projects have different code styles for different directories
            or files depending on their sources, in which case respect the per-file style.</p>

            <p>For new projects, follow the official code style for the language. Treat the
            standard library APIs as defining the naming style for usage of the language, i.e. C
            uses <code>variable_or_function_name</code>, <code>type_name</code>,
            <code>MACRO_NAME</code> while JavaScript uses <code>variable_or_function_name</code>,
            <code>ClassName</code> and <code>CONSTANT_NAME</code>. For Python, follow PEP8 and the
            same goes for other languages with official styles whether defined in a document or by
            the default mode for the official formatting tool like <code>rustfmt</code>.</p>

            <p>For cases where there isn't an official or prevailing code style for other things,
            avoid tabs, use 4-space indents, <code>function_name</code>,
            <code>variable_name</code>, <code>TypeName</code> and <code>CONSTANT_NAME</code>.
            Prefer single-line comment syntax other than rare cases where it makes sense to add a
            tiny comment within a line of code. In languages with the optional braces misfeature
            (C, C++, Java), always use them. Open braces on the same line as function definitions
            / statements. Wrap lines at 100 columns except in rare cases where it would be far
            uglier to wrap the line.</p>

            <p>For JavaScript, put <code>"use strict";</code> at the top of every file, end lines
            with semicolons (since automatic insertion is poorly designed) and always use
            <code>const</code> to declare variables, unless they are reassigned in which case they
            should be declared with <code>let</code> but never use <code>var</code> as it is
            effectively broken. Try to prefer loops with <code>for..of</code>.</p>

            <p>For web content, use dashes as user-facing word separators rather than underscores.
            Page titles should follow the scheme "Page | Directory | Higher-level directory |
            Site" for usability with a traditional title as the Open Graph title.</p>

            <p>Avoid designing around class inheritance unless it's a rare case where it's an
            extremely good fit or the language sucks (Java) and it's the least bad approach, but
            still try to avoid it.</p>

            <p>Use concise but self-explanatory variable names. Prefer communicating information
            via naming rather than using comments whenever possible. Don't name variables
            <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, etc. like C programmers. It's okay to
            use things like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for parameters if the function is
            genuinely that generic and operates on arbitrary values. In general, try to scope
            variables into the most limited scope (in C or C++, be careful about this when
            references are taken).</p>

            <p>Write code that's clean and self-explanatory. Use comments to explain or justify
            non-obvious things, but try to avoid needing them in the first place. In most cases,
            they should just be communicating non-local information such as explaining why an
            invariant is true based on the code elsewhere (consider a runtime check to make sure
            it's true, or an assertion if performance would be an issue). Docstrings at the top of
            top-level functions, modules, etc. are a different story and shouldn't be avoided.</p>

            <h3 id="library-usage">
                <a href="#library-usage">Library usage</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Make extensive usage of well designed standard library modules. For apps, treat
            Jetpack (androidx) as part of the standard library and make good use of it. For Java,
            Guava can also be treated as part of the standard library.</p>

            <p>Libraries outside of the standard library should be used very cautiously. They
            should be well maintained, stable, well tested and widely used. Libraries implemented
            with memory unsafe languages should generally be avoided (one exception: SQLite).</p>

            <p>Generally, frameworks and libraries existing solely to provide different paradigms
            and coding patterns are to be avoided. They increase barrier to entry for developers,
            generally only increase complexity unless used at very large scales (and may not even
            make things simpler in those cases) and come and go as fads. This is only okay when
            it's part of the standard libraries or libraries that are considered standard
            (androidx, Guava) by GrapheneOS and should still be approached cautiously. Only use it
            if it truly makes the correct approach simpler. Ignore fads and figure out if it
            actually makes sense to use, otherwise just stick to the old fashioned way if the
            fancy alternatives aren't genuinely better.</p>
