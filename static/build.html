            <p>You likely want to use the most recent stable tag, not the development branch, even
            for developing a feature. It's easier to port between stable tags that are known to
            work properly than dealing with a moving target.</p>

            <p>The pie branch is currently used for all devices other than the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, and is the correct branch to use for the generic targets or properly specialized ports to new devices:</p>

            <p>If your network is unreliable and <code>repo sync</code> fails, you can run the
            <code>repo sync</code> command again as many times as needed for it to fully

            <p>To update the source tree, run the <code>repo init</code> command again to select
            the branch or tag and then run <code>repo sync -j32</code> again. You may need to add
            <code>--force-sync</code> if a repository from switched from one source to another,
            such as when GrapheneOS forks an additional Android Open Source Project repository.
            You don't need to start over to switch between different branches or tags. You may
            need to run <code>repo init</code> again to continue down the same branch since
            GrapheneOS only provides a stable history via tags.</p>

            <h2 id="browser-and-webview">
                <a href="#browser-and-webview">Browser and WebView</a>
            </h2>

            Before building GrapheneOS, you need to build Chromium for the WebView and
            <em>optionally</em> the standalone browser app. GrapheneOS uses a hardened fork of
            Chromium for these. It needs to be rebuilt when Chromium is updated or the GrapheneOS
            <code>Vanadium</code> patches change.

            Chromium and the WebView are independent applications built from the Chromium source tree. The
            GrapheneOS Chromium build is located at external/chromium and includes the WebView.

            See <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/android-build-instructions">
            Chromium's Android build instructions</a> for details on obtaining the prerequisites.

            <p>You can obtain the proper configuration from the
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium">
            GrapheneOS Vanadium repository</a> in <code>args.gn</code> the correct version.</p>

            <pre>git clone https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium.git
cd Vanadium</pre>

            <p>Fetch the Chromium sources:</p>

            <pre>fetch --nohooks android</pre>

            <p>Sync to the latest stable release for Android (replace $VERSION with the correct
            value):</p>

            <pre>gclient sync -D --with_branch_heads -r $VERSION --jobs 32</pre>

            <p>Apply the GrapheneOS patches on top of the tagged release:</p>

            <pre>cd src
git am ../*.patch</pre>

            <p>Then, configure the build in the <code>src</code> directory:</p>

            <pre>gn args out/Default</pre>

            <p>Copy the GrapheneOS configuration from <code>../args.gn</code> and save/exit the
            editor.</p>

            <p>To build Monochrome, which provides both Chromium and the WebView:</p>

            <pre>ninja -C out/Default/ monochrome_public_apk</pre>

            <p>The apk needs to be copied from <code>out/Default/apks/MonochromePublic.apk</code>
            into the Android source tree at
            <code>external/chromium/prebuilt/arm64/MonochromePublic.apk</code></p>

            <p>Standalone builds of Chromium and the WebView can be done via the
            <code>chrome_modern_public_apk</code> and <code>system_webview_apk</code> targets but
            those aren't used by GrapheneOS. The build system isn't set up for including them and
            the standalone WebView isn't whitelisted in
            <code>frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/config_webview_packages</code>.</p>

            <h2 id="kernel">
                <a href="#kernel">Kernel</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The kernel needs to be built in advance, since it uses a separate build system.</p>

            <p>For the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, the kernel repository uses submodules for building
            in out-of-tree modules. You need to make sure the submodule sources are updated before
            building. In the future, this should end up being handled automatically by
            <code>repo</code>.</p>

            <p>For example, to build the kernel for blueline:</p>

            <pre>cd kernel/google/crosshatch
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init
./build.sh blueline</pre>

            <p>The <code>kernel/google/marlin</code> repository is for the Pixel and Pixel XL, the
            <code>kernel/google/wahoo</code> repository is for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL and the
            <code>kernel/google/crosshatch</code> repository is for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3
            XL.</p>

            <p><em>For the first generation Pixel (sailfish) and Pixel XL (marlin), signed
            releases require building the verity public key into the kernel so the keys need to be
            generated per the instructions below before building the kernel.</em></p>

            </h2>

            <p>The build has to be done from bash as envsetup.sh is not compatible with other
            shells like zsh.</p>

            <p>Set up the build environment:</p>

            <pre>source script/envsetup.sh</pre>

            <p>Select the desired build target (<code>aosp_crosshatch</code> is the Pixel 3 XL):

            <pre>choosecombo release aosp_crosshatch user</pre>

            <p>For a development build, you may want to replace <code>user</code> with
            <code>userdebug</code> in order to have better debugging support. Production builds
            should be <code>user</code> builds as they are significantly more secure and don't
            make additional performance sacrifices to improve debugging.</p>

            <h2 id="reproducible-builds">
                <a href="#reproducible-builds">Reproducible builds</a>
            </h2>

            <p>To reproduce a past build, you need to export <code>BUILD_DATETIME</code> and
            <code>BUILD_NUMBER</code> to the values set for the past build. These can be obtained
            from <code>out/build_date.txt</code> and <code>out/build_number.txt</code> in a build
            output directory and the <code>ro.build.date.utc</code> and
            <code>ro.build.version.incremental</code> properties which are also included in the
            over-the-air zip metadata rather than just the OS itself.</p>

            <p>The signing process for release builds is done after completing builds and replaces
            the dm-verity trees, apk signatures, etc. and can only be reproduced with access to
            the same private keys. If you want to compare to production builds signed with
            different keys you need to stick to comparing everything other than the
            signatures.</p>

                <a href="#extracting-vendor-files-for-pixel-devices">Extracting vendor files for Pixel devices</a>
            </h2>

            <p>This section does not apply to devices where no extra vendor files are required (HiKey, HiKey 960, emulator, generic targets).</p>

            <p>Many of these components are already open source, but not everything is set up to
            be built by the Android Open Source Project build system. Switching to building these
            components from source will be an incremental effort. In many cases, the vendor files
            simply need to be ignored and AOSP will already provide them instead. Firmware cannot
            generally be built from source even when sources are available, other than to verify
            that the official builds match the sources, since it has signature verification (which
            is an important part of the verified boot and attestation security model).</p>

            <p>Extract the vendor files corresponding to the matching release:</p>

            <pre>vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d DEVICE -b BUILD_ID -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor
mkdir -p vendor/google_devices
rm -rf vendor/google_devices/DEVICE
mv vendor/android-prepare-vendor/DEVICE/BUILD_ID/vendor/google_devices/* vendor/google_devices/</pre>

            <p>Note that android-prepare-vendor is non-deterministic unless a timestamp parameter is
            passed with <code>--timestamp</code> (seconds since Epoch).</p>

            <h2 id="building">
                <a href="#building">Building</a>
            </h2>

            <p>Incremental builds (i.e. starting from the old build) usually work for development
            and are the normal way to develop changes. However, there are cases where changes are
            not properly picked up by the build system. For production builds, you should remove
            the remnants of any past builds before starting, particularly if there were
            non-trivial changes:</p>

            <pre>rm -r out</pre>

            <p>Start the build process, with -j# used to set the number of parallel jobs to the
            number of CPU threads. You also need 2-4GiB of memory per job, so reduce it based on
            available memory if necessary:</p>

            <pre>make target-files-package -j20</pre>

            <h2 id="faster-builds-for-development-use-only">
                <a href="#faster-builds-for-development-use-only">Faster builds for development use only</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The normal production build process involves building a target files package to be
            resigned with secure release keys and then converted into factory images and/or an
            update zip via the sections below. If you have a dedicated development device with no
            security requirements, you can save time by using the default make target, leaving the
            bootloader unlocked and flashing the raw images that are signed with the default
            public test keys:</p>

            <pre>make -j20</pre>

            <p>Technically, you could generate test key signed update packages. However, there's
            no point of sideloading update packages when the bootloader is unlocked and there's no
            value in a locked bootloader without signing the build using release keys, since
            verified boot will be meaningless and the keys used to verify sideloaded updates are
            also public. The only reason to use update packages or a locked bootloader without
            signing the build with release keys would be testing that functionality and it makes a
            lot more sense to test it with proper signing keys rather than the default public test
            keys.</p>

            <h2 id="generating-release-signing-keys">
                <a href="#generating-release-signing-keys">Generating release signing keys</a>
            </h2>

            <p>Keys need to be generated for resigning completed builds from the publicly
            available test keys.  The keys must then be reused for subsequent builds and cannot be
            changed without flashing the generated factory images again which will perform a
            factory reset. Note that the keys are used for a lot more than simply verifying
            updates and verified boot.</p>

            <p>The keys should not be given passwords due to limitations in the upstream scripts.
            If you want to secure them at rest, you should take a different approach where they
            can still be available to the signing scripts as a directory of unencrypted keys. The
            sample certificate subject can be replaced with your own information or simply left
            as-is.</p>

            <p>The Pixel and Pixel XL use Android Verified Boot 1.0. The Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL,
            Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL use Android Verified Boot 2.0 (AVB). Follow the appropriate

            <p>The factory images and update package will be in
            <code>out/release-crosshatch-$BUILD_NUMBER</code>. The update zip performs a full OS
            installation so it can be used to update from any previous version. More efficient
            incremental updates are used for official over-the-air GrapheneOS updates and can be
            generated by keeping around past signed <code>target_files</code> zips and generating
            incremental updates from those to the most recent signed <code>target_files</code>
            zip.</p>

            Like the Android Open Source Project, GrapheneOS contains some code that's built
            separately and then bundled into the source tree as binaries. This section will be
            gradually expanded to cover building all of it.

            </h3>

            <p>The Auditor app is simply built from the latest upstream tag and bundled as an apk into
            external/ repositories. There are no modifications to it for GrapheneOS.</p>

                <a href="#testing">Testing</a>
            </h2>

            <p>This section will be expanded to cover various test suites and testing procedures
            rather than only the current very minimal coverage of the Compatibility Test Suite
            (CTS).</p>

            <h3 id="compatibility-test-suite">
                <a href="#compatibility-test-suite">Compatibility Test Suite</a>
            </h3>

            </h4>

            <p>Testing with the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) can be done by either building the
            test suite from source or using the official releases.</p>
            <p>Official releases of the CTS can be downloaded from
            <a href="https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/downloads">the Compatibility
            Suite Downloads page</a>. You should download the CTS for the relevant release
            (Android 9) and architecture (ARM). There's a separate zip for the main CTS, the
            manual portion (CTS Verifier) and the CTS for Instant Apps. The latest release of the
            CTS Media Files also needs to be downloaded from that section.</p>

            <h4 id="compatibility-test-suite-setup">
                <a href="#compatibility-test-suite-setup">Setup</a>
            </h4>
            <p>You'll need a device attached to your computer with ADB enabled along with the
            Android SDK installed. The build-tools and platform-tools packages need to be
            installed and the binaries need to be added to your PATH. For example, with the SDK
            located at <code>/home/username</code>:</p>
            <pre>export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/sdk"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/sdk/tools:$HOME/sdk/tools/bin:$HOME/sdk/platform-tools:$HOME/sdk/build-tools/27.0.3:$HOME/sdk/ndk-bundle"</pre>
            <p>Copy media onto the device:</p>
            <pre>cd android-cts-media-1.4
./copy_images.sh
./copy_media.sh</pre>

            <p>You also need to do some basic setup for the device. It's possible for changes from
            a baseline install to cause interference, so it can be a good idea to factory reset
            the device if assorted changes have been made. The device needs to be running a user
            build for the security model to be fully intact in order to pass all the security
            tests. A userdebug build is expected to fail some of the tests. GrapheneOS also makes
            various changes intentionally deviating from the requirements expected by the CTS, so
            there will always be some expected failures. A few of the tests are also known to be
            quite flaky or broken even with the stock OS and/or AOSP. These will be documented
            here at some point.</p>

            <ul>

                <a href="#compatibility-test-suite-run-modules">Run modules</a>
            </h4>

            <p>Run the test harness:</p>
            <pre>./android-cts/tools/cts-tradefed</pre>
            <p>Note that <code>_JAVA_OPTIONS</code> being set will break the version detection.</p>
            <p>To obtain a list of CTS modules:</p>
            <pre>list modules</pre>
            <p>To run a specific module and avoid wasting time capturing device information:</p>
            <pre>run cts --skip-device-info --module CtsModuleName</pre>
            <p>To speed up initialization after running some initial tests:</p>
            <pre>run cts --skip-device-info --skip-preconditions --module CtsModuleName</pre>
            <p>It's possible to run the whole standard CTS plan with a single command, but running
            specific modules is recommended, especially if you don't have everything set up for
            the entire test suite.</p>
