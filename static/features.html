            <h1><a href="#features">Features overview</a></h1>

            <p>GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system with great functionality
            and usability. It starts from the strong baseline of the
            <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project (AOSP)</a> and
            takes great care to avoid increasing attack surface or hurting the strong security
            model. GrapheneOS makes substantial improvements to both privacy and security through
            many carefully designed features built to function against real adversaries. The
            project cares a lot about usability and app compatibility so those are taken into
            account for all of our features.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is focused on substance rather than branding and marketing. It doesn't
            take the typical approach of piling on a bunch of insecure features depending on the
            adversaries not knowing about them and regressing actual privacy/security. It's a very
            technical project building privacy and security into the OS rather than including
            assorted unhelpful frills or bundling subjective third party apps choices.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is also hard at work on filling in gaps from not bundling Google apps
            and services into the OS. We aren't against users using Google services but it doesn't
            belong integrated into the OS in an invasive way. GrapheneOS won't take the shortcut
            of simply bundling a very incomplete and poorly secured third party reimplementation
            of Google services into the OS. That wouldn't ever be something users could rely upon.
            It will also always be chasing a moving target while offering poorer security than the
            real thing if the focus is on simply getting things working without great care for
            doing it robustly and securely.</p>

            <p>This page provides an overview of currently implemented features differentiating
            GrapheneOS from AOSP. It doesn't document our many historical features that are no
            longer included for one reason or another. Many of our features were implemented in
            AOSP, Linux, <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and other projects GrapheneOS is
            based on and those aren't listed here. In many cases, we've been involved in getting
            those features implemented in core infrastructure projects.</p>

                <p>Partial list of GrapheneOS features beyond what AOSP 12 provides:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hardened app runtime</li>
                    <li>Stronger app sandbox</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_bionic">Hardened libc</a>
                    providing defenses against the most common classes of vulnerabilities (memory
                    corruption)</li>
                    <li>
                        Our own <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc">hardened
                        malloc (memory allocator)</a> leveraging modern hardware capabilities
                        to provide substantial defenses against the most common classes of
                        vulnerabilities (heap memory corruption) along with reducing the lifetime
                        of sensitive data in memory. The <a
                        href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/main/README.md">hardened_malloc
                        README</a> has extensive documentation on it. The hardened_malloc
                        project is portable to other Linux-based operating systems and is being
                        adopted by other security-focused operating systems like Whonix.  Our
                        allocator also heavily influenced the design of the <a
                        href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">next-generation
                        musl malloc implementation</a> which offers substantially better security than
                        musl's previous malloc while still having minimal memory usage and code size.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fully out-of-line metadata with protection from corruption, ruling
                            out traditional allocator exploitation</li>
                            <li>Separate memory regions for metadata, large allocations and each
                            slab allocation size class with high entropy random bases and no
                            address space reuse between the different regions</li>
                            <li>Deterministic detection of any invalid free</li>
                            <li>Zero-on-free with detection of write-after-free via checking that
                            memory is still zeroed before handing it out again</li>
                            <li>Delayed reuse of address space and memory allocations through the
                            combination of deterministic and randomized quarantines to mitigate
                            use-after-free vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>Fine-grained randomization</li>
                            <li>Aggressive consistency checks</li>
                            <li>Memory protected guard regions around allocations larger than 16k
                            with randomization of guard region sizes for 128k and above</li>
                            <li>Allocations smaller than 16k have guard regions around each of the
                            slabs containing allocations (for example, 16 byte allocations are in
                            4096 byte slabs with 4096 byte guard regions before and after)</li>
                            <li>Random canaries with a leading zero are added to these smaller
                            allocations to block C string overflows, absorb small overflows
                            and detect linear overflows or other heap corruption when the
                            canary value is checked (primarily on free)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Hardened compiler toolchain</li>
                    <li>
                        Hardened kernel
                        <ul>
                            <li>Support for dynamically loaded kernel modules is disabled and
                            the minimal set of modules for the device model are built into the
                            kernel to substantially improve the granularity of Control Flow
                            Integrity (CFI) and reduce attack surface.</li>
                            <li>4-level page tables are enabled on arm64 to provide a much larger
                            address space (48-bit instead of 39-bit) with significantly higher
                            entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (33-bit instead of
                            24-bit).</li>
                            <li>Random canaries with a leading zero are added to the kernel heap
                            (slub) to block C string overflows, absorb small overflows and detect
                            linear overflows or other heap corruption when the canary value is
                            checked (on free, copies to/from userspace, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Memory is wiped (zeroed) as soon as it's released in both the
                            low-level kernel page allocator and higher level kernel heap allocator
                            (slub). This substantially reduces the lifetime of sensitive data in
                            memory, mitigates use-after-free vulnerabilities and makes most
                            uninitialized data usage vulnerabilities harmless. Without our
                            changes, memory that's released retains data indefinitely until the
                            memory is handed out for other uses and gets partially or fully
                            overwritten by new data.</li>
                            <li>Kernel stack allocations are zeroed to make most uninitialized
                            data usage vulnerabilities harmless.</li>
                            <li>Assorted attack surface reduction through disabling features or
                            setting up infrastructure to dynamically enable/disable them only as
                            needed (perf, ptrace).</li>
                            <li>Assorted upstream hardening features are enabled, including many
                            which we played a part in developing and landing upstream as part of
                            our linux-hardened project (which we intend to revive as a more active
                            project again).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Prevention of dynamic native code execution in-memory or via the filesystem
                    for the base OS without going via the package manager, etc.</li>
                    <li>Filesystem access hardening</li>
                    <li>Enhanced <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot">verified boot</a>
                    with better security properties and reduced attack surface</li>
                    <li>Enhanced hardware-based attestation with more precise version information</li>
                    <li>Eliminates remaining holes for apps to access hardware-based identifiers</li>
                    <li>Greatly reduced remote, local and proximity-based attack surface by
                    stripping out unnecessary code, making more features optional and disabling
                    optional features by default (NFC, Bluetooth, etc.), when the screen is
                    locked (connecting new USB peripherals, camera access) and optionally after a
                    timeout (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)</li>
                    <li>Option to disable native debugging (ptrace) to reduce local attack surface
                    (still enabled by default for compatibility)</li>
                    <li>Low-level improvements to the <a href="/faq#encryption">filesystem-based
                    full disk encryption</a> used on modern Android</li>
                    <li>Support for logging out of user profiles without needing a device manager:
                    makes them inactive so that they can't continue running code while using
                    another profile and purges the disk encryption keys (which are per-profile)
                    from memory and hardware registers</li>
                    <li>Option to enable automatically rebooting the device when no profile has
                    been unlocked for the configured time period to put the device fully at rest
                    again.</li>
                    <li>Modern Microphone/Camera usage indicator UX is also used for Location.</li>
                    <li>Improved user visibility into persistent firmware security through version
                    and configuration verification with reporting of inconsistencies and debug
                    features being enabled.</li>
                    <li>Support longer passwords by default (64 characters) without a device manager</li>
                    <li>Stricter implementation of the optional fingerprint unlock feature permitting
                    only 5 attempts rather than 20 before permanent lockout (our recommendation is
                    still keeping sensitive data in user profiles without fingerprint unlock)</li>
                    <li>Support for using the fingerprint scanner only for authentication in apps
                    and unlocking hardware keystore keys by toggling off support for unlocking.</li>
                    <li>PIN scrambling option</li>
                    <li><a href="/usage#lte-only-mode">LTE-only mode</a> to reduce cellular radio
                    attack surface by disabling enormous amounts of both legacy code (2G, 3G) and
                    bleeding edge code (5G)</li>
                    <li><a href="/usage#wifi-privacy-associated">Per-connection MAC randomization
                    option (enabled by default)</a> as a more private option than the standard
                    persistent per-network random MAC.</li>
                    <li>When the per-connection MAC randomization added by GrapheneOS is being
                    used, DHCP client state is flushed before reconnecting to a network to avoid
                    revealing that it's likely the same device as before.</li>
                    <li>Improved IPv6 privacy addresses to prevent tracking across networks</li>
                    <li>Vanadium: hardened WebView and default browser — the WebView is what most
                    other apps use to handle web content, so you benefit from Vanadium in many apps
                    even if you choose another browser</li>
                    <li>Hardware-based security verification and monitoring: the
                    <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases">Auditor app</a> app and
                    <a href="https://attestation.app/">attestation service</a> provide strong
                    hardware-based verification of the authenticity and integrity of the
                    firmware/software on the device. A strong pairing-based approach is used which
                    also provides verification of the device's identity based on the hardware backed
                    key generated for each pairing. Software-based checks are layered on top with
                    trust securely chained from the hardware. For more details, see the
                    <a href="https://attestation.app/about">about page</a>

                    hardened PDF viewer using HiDPI rendering with pinch to zoom, text selection,
                    etc.</li>

                    <li>Encrypted backups via integration of the
                    <a href="https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault">Seedvault app</a> with
                    support for local backups and any cloud storage provider with a storage provider

                    sharing address space layout and other secrets across applications</li>
                    <li>Network permission toggle for disallowing both direct and indirect access
                    to any of the available networks. The device-local network (localhost) is also
                    guarded by this permission, which is important for preventing apps from using
                    it to communicate between profiles. Unlike a firewall-based implementation,
                    the Network permission toggle prevents apps from using the network via APIs
                    provided by the OS or other apps in the same profile as long as they're marked
                    appropriately.</li>
                    <li>The standard INTERNET permission used as the basis for the Network
                    permission toggle is enhanced with a second layer of enforcement and proper
                    support for granting/revoking it on a per-profile basis.</li>
                    <li>Sensors permission toggle: disallow access to all other sensors not covered by
                    existing Android permissions (Camera, Microphone, Body Sensors, Activity
                    Recognition) including an accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, barometer,
                    thermometer and any other sensors present on a given device. To avoid breaking
                    compatibility with Android apps, the added permission is enabled by
                    default.</li>
                    <li>Authenticated encryption for network time updates via a first party server to
                    prevent attackers from changing the time and enabling attacks based on bypassing
                    certificate / key expiry, etc.</li>
                    <li>Proper support for disabling network time updates rather than just not using
                    the results</li>
                    <li>Connectivity checks via a first party server with the option to revert to the
                    standard checks (to blend in) or to fully disable them</li>
                    <li>Hardened local build / signing infrastructure</li>
                    <li><a href="/usage#updates">Seamless automatic OS update system</a> that just
                    works and stays out of the way in the background without disrupting device
                    usage, with full support for the standard automatic rollback if the first boot
                    of the updated OS fails</li>
                    <li>Require unlocking to access sensitive functionality via quick tiles</li>
                    <li>Minor changes to default settings to prefer privacy over small conveniences:
                    personalized keyboard suggestions based on gathering input history are disabled by
                    default, sensitive notifications are hidden on the lockscreen by default and
                    passwords are hidden during entry by default</li>
                    <li><a href="/faq#bundled-apps">Minimal bundled apps and services</a>. Only
                    essential apps are integrated into the OS. We don't make partnerships with
                    apps and services to bundle them into the OS. An app may be the best choice
                    today and poor choice in the future. Our approach will be recommending certain
                    apps during the initial setup, not hard-wiring them into the OS.</li>
                    <li>No Google apps and services. These can be used on GrapheneOS but only if
                    they avoid requiring invasive OS integration. Building privileged support for
                    Google services into the OS isn't something we're going to be doing, even if
                    that's partially open source like microG.</li>
