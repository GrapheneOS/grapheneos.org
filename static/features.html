            <h1><a href="#features">Features overview</a></h1>

            <p>GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system with great functionality
            and usability. It starts from the strong baseline of the
            <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project (AOSP)</a> and
            takes great care to avoid increasing attack surface or hurting the strong security
            model. GrapheneOS makes substantial improvements to both privacy and security through
            many carefully designed features built to function against real adversaries. The
            project cares a lot about usability and app compatibility so those are taken into
            account for all of our features.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is focused on substance rather than branding and marketing. It doesn't
            take the typical approach of piling on a bunch of insecure features depending on the
            adversaries not knowing about them and regressing actual privacy/security. It's a very
            technical project building privacy and security into the OS rather than including
            assorted unhelpful frills or bundling subjective third party apps choices.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is also hard at work on filling in gaps from not bundling Google apps
            and services into the OS. We aren't against users using Google services but it doesn't
            belong integrated into the OS in an invasive way. GrapheneOS won't take the shortcut
            of simply bundling a very incomplete and poorly secured third party reimplementation
            of Google services into the OS. That wouldn't ever be something users could rely upon.
            It will also always be chasing a moving target while offering poorer security than the
            real thing if the focus is on simply getting things working without great care for
            doing it robustly and securely.</p>

            <p>This page provides an overview of currently implemented features differentiating
            GrapheneOS from AOSP. It doesn't document our many historical features that are no
            longer included for one reason or another. Many of our features were implemented in
            AOSP, Linux, <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and other projects GrapheneOS is
            based on and those aren't listed here. In many cases, we've been involved in getting
            those features implemented in core infrastructure projects.</p>

                <h2><a href="#grapheneos">GrapheneOS</a></h2>

                <p>These are the features of GrapheneOS beyond what's provided by version 14 of
                the Android Open Source Project. It only covers our improvements to AOSP and not
                baseline features. This section doesn't list features like the standard app
                sandbox, verified boot, exploit mitigations (ASLR, SSP, Shadow Call Stack, Control
                Flow Integrity, etc.), permission system (foreground-only and one-time permission
                grants, scoped file access control, etc.) and so on but rather only our
                improvements to modern Android. We plan on providing a separate page listing the
                improvements we've contributed to Android since those features aren't listed here
                despite being a substantial portion of our overall historical work.</p>

                <section id="exploit-protection">
                    <h3><a href="#exploit-protection">Defending against exploitation of unknown
                    vulnerabilities</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS is heavily focused on protecting users against attackers
                    exploiting unknown (0 day) vulnerabilities. Patching vulnerabilities doesn't
                    protect users before the vulnerability is known to the vendor and has a patch
                    developed and shipped.</p>

                    <p>Unknown (0 day) vulnerabilities are much more widely used than most realize
                    to exploit users not just in targeted attacks but in broad deployments.
                    Project Zero maintains
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/view#gid=0">a
                    spreadsheet</a> tracking zero day exploitation detected in the wild. This is
                    only a peek into what's happening since it only documents cases where the
                    attackers were caught exploiting users, often because the attacks are not
                    targeted but rather deployed on public websites, etc.</p>

                    <p>The first line of defense is attack surface reduction. Removing unnecessary
                    code or exposed attack surface eliminates many vulnerabilities completely.
                    GrapheneOS avoids removing any useful functionality for end users, but we can
                    still disable lots of functionality by default and require that users opt-in
                    to using it to eliminate it for most of them. An example we landed upstream in
                    Android is disallowing using the kernel's profiling support by default, since
                    it was and still is a major source of Linux kernel vulnerabilities. Profiling
                    is now only exposed to apps for developers who enable developer tools, enable
                    the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and then use profiling tools via ADB. It's also
                    only enabled until the next boot. This isn't listed below since it's one of
                    the features we got implemented in Android itself.</p>

                    <p>The next line of defense is preventing an attacker from exploiting a
                    vulnerability, either by making it impossible, unreliable or at least
                    meaningfully harder to develop. The vast majority of vulnerabilities are well
                    understood classes of bugs and exploitation can be prevented by avoiding the
                    bugs via languages/tooling or preventing exploitation with strong exploit
                    mitigations. In many cases, vulnerability classes can be completely wiped out
                    while in many others they can at least be made meaningfully harder to exploit.
                    Android does a lot of work in this area and GrapheneOS has helped to advance
                    this in Android and the Linux kernel. It takes an enormous amount of resources
                    to develop fundamental fixes for these problems and there's often a high
                    performance, memory or compatibility cost to deploying them. Mainstream
                    operating systems usually don't prioritize security over other areas.
                    GrapheneOS is willing to go further and we offer toggles for users to choose
                    the compromises they prefer instead of forcing it on them. In the meantime,
                    weaker less complete exploit mitigations can still provide meaningful barriers
                    against attacks as long as they're developed with a clear threat model.
                    GrapheneOS is heavily invested in many areas of developing these protections:
                    developing/deploying memory safe languages / libraries, static/dynamic
                    analysis tooling and many kinds of mitigations.</p>

                    <p>The final line of defense is containment through sandboxing at various
                    levels: fine-grained sandboxes around a specific context like per site browser
                    renderers, sandboxes around a specific component like Android's media codec
                    sandbox and app / workspace sandboxes like the Android app sandbox used to
                    sandbox each app which is also the basis for user/work profiles. GrapheneOS
                    improves all of these sandboxes through fortifying the kernel and other base
                    OS components along with improving the sandboxing policies.</p>

                    <p>Preventing an attacker from persisting their control of a component or the
                    OS / firmware through verified boot and avoiding trust in persistent state
                    also helps to mitigate the damage after a compromise has occurred.</p>

                    <p>Remote code execution vulnerabilities are the most serious and allow an
                    attacker to gain a foothold on device or even substantial control over it
                    remotely. Local code execution vulnerabilities allow breaking out of a sandbox
                    including the app sandbox or browser renderer sandbox after either
                    compromising an app / browser renderer remotely, compromising an app's supply
                    chain or getting the user to install a malicious app. Many other kinds of
                    vulnerabilities exist but most of what we're protecting against falls into
                    these 2 broad categories.</p>

                    <p>The vast majority of local and remote code execution vulnerabilities are
                    memory corruption bugs caused by memory unsafe languages or rare low-level
                    unsafe code in an otherwise memory safe language. Most of the remaining issues
                    are caused by dynamic code execution/loading features. Our main focus is on
                    preventing or raising the difficulty of exploiting memory corruption bugs
                    followed by restricting dynamic code execution both to make escalation from a
                    memory corruption bug harder and to directly mitigate bugs caused by dynamic
                    code loading/generation/execution such as a JIT compiler bug or a plugin
                    loading vulnerability.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Greatly reduced remote, local and proximity-based attack surface by
                            stripping out unnecessary code, making more features optional and disabling
                            optional features by default (NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, etc.), when the screen is
                            locked (connecting new USB peripherals, camera access) and optionally after a
                            timeout (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)</li>
                            <li>Native debugging (ptrace) access is blocked for all bundled apps to
                            reduce local attack surface. ptrace access is allowed by default for user
                            installed apps for compatibility, with an option to block it by default. In
                            both cases, ptrace access can be blocked or allowed manually on a per-app
                            basis. When an app that is blocked from accessing ptrace tries to use it,
                            GrapheneOS shows a notification that links the per-app native debugging
                            settings screen.</li>

                        <p>GrapheneOS improves the app sandbox through hardening SELinux policy
                        and seccomp-bpf policy along with all the hardening to components like
                        kernel implementing the app sandbox and providing a path for the attacker
                        to escape it if they can exploit those components. We primarily focus on
                        the app sandbox, but we also improve the other sandboxes including making
                        direct improvements to the web browser renderer sandbox used for both the
                        default browser and WebView rendering engine provided by the OS and used
                        by a huge number of other apps from dedicated browsers to messaging

                            <li>GrapheneOS finishes the incomplete implementation of verified boot
                            for out-of-band updates to packages (APKs) in the OS. We enforce this
                            by requiring fs-verity metadata signed with a trusted key for system
                            app updates both at install time and boot time. This provides
                            continuous verification where every read from an out-of-band APK
                            update is verified similarly to every read from a firmware, OS image
                            or APEX update being verified. The signing key and version are
                            enforced to prevent downgrades or other attacks such as replacing a
                            package with a variant of the same one from a different GrapheneOS
                            supported device. We disable the persistent package parsing cache to
                            prevent bypassing the metadata checks through this otherwise highly
                            persistent state, which only has a very small negative impact on boot
                            time from the data not being available from previous boots (typically

                            as part of changes to the OS. We enforce this both at package install

                    <p>GrapheneOS includes fixes for a large number of vulnerabilities not yet
                    fixed in Android.</p>

                    <p>We're able to quickly and safely ship the latest Linux kernel LTS point
                    releases on devices with GKI (Generic Kernel Image) support including the 6th
                    and 7th generation Pixel phones. At the time of writing on 2023-11-06,
                    GrapheneOS is using the latest Linux 5.10 GKI LTS release (5.10.199) for 6th
                    and 7th generation Pixel phones. The stock Pixel OS is on Linux 5.10.157 from
                    2022-12-02 with a small number of additional patches backported. This means
                    GrapheneOS provides hundreds of relevant kernel patches including many
                    security patches not yet included in the stock OS. It's possible for us to
                    stay several months ahead due to their approach of moving to new LTS releases
                    only in quarterly releases after a long freeze and testing process.</p>

                    <p>We often find new vulnerabilities ourselves and report them upstream. We've
                    reported dozens of vulnerabilities for both the generic Android codebase and
                    also for Pixels specifically. We also often find missed patches which were
                    supposed to be included but were missed, especially when there are device
                    specific components with partially shared but separate codebases for different
                    devices.</p>

                    <p>Our overall approach is to focus on systemic privacy and security
                    improvements but fixing individual vulnerabilities is still very
                    important.</p>

                <section id="sandboxed-google-play">
                    <h3><a href="#sandboxed-google-play">Sandboxed Google Play</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS has a compatibility layer providing the option to install and use
                    the official releases of Google Play in the standard app sandbox. Google Play
                    receives absolutely no special access or privileges on GrapheneOS as opposed to
                    bypassing the app sandbox and receiving a massive amount of highly privileged
                    access. Instead, the compatibility layer teaches it how to work within the full
                    app sandbox. It also isn't used as a backend for the OS services as it would be
                    elsewhere since GrapheneOS doesn't use Google Play even when it's installed.</p>

                    <p>Since the Google Play apps are simply regular apps on GrapheneOS, you install
                    them within a specific user or work profile and they're only available within that
                    profile. Only apps within the same profile can use it and they need to explicitly
                    choose to use it. It works the same way as any other app and has no special
                    capabilities. As with any other app, it can't access data of other apps and
                    requires explicit user consent to gain access to profile data or the standard
                    permissions. Apps within the same profile can communicate with mutual consent and
                    it's no different for sandboxed Google Play.</p>

                    <p>Sandboxed Google Play is close to being fully functional and provides near
                    complete compatibility with the app ecosystem depending on Google Play. Only a
                    small subset of privileged functionality which we haven't yet ported to
                    different approaches with our compatibility layer is unavailable. Some
                    functionality is inherently privileged and can't be provided as part of the
                    compatibility layer.</p>

                    <p>The vast majority of Play services functionality works perfectly including
                    dynamically downloaded / updated modules (dynamite modules) and functionality
                    provided by modular app components such as Google Play Games. By default,
                    location requests are rerouted to a reimplementation of the Play geolocation
                    service provided by GrapheneOS. You can disable rerouting and use the standard
                    Play services geolocation service instead if you want the Google network
                    location service and related features.</p>

                    <p>Our compatibility layer includes full support for the Play Store. Play
                    Store services are fully available including in-app purchases, Play Asset
                    Delivery, Play Feature Delivery and app / content license checks. It can
                    install, update and uninstall apps with the standard approach requiring that
                    the user authorizes it as an app source and consents to each action. It will
                    use the standard Android 12+ unattended update feature to do automatic updates
                    for apps where it was the last installer.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#network-permission-toggle">Network permission toggle</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS adds a Network permission toggle for disallowing both direct and
                    indirect access to any of the available networks. The device-local network
                    (localhost) is also guarded by this permission, which is important for
                    preventing apps from using it to communicate between profiles. Unlike a
                    firewall-based implementation, the Network permission toggle prevents apps
                    from using the network via APIs provided by the OS or other apps in the same
                    profile as long as they're marked appropriately.</p>

                    <p>The standard INTERNET permission used as the basis for the Network
                    permission toggle is enhanced with a second layer of enforcement and proper
                    support for granting/revoking it on a per-profile basis.</p>

                    <p>To avoid breaking compatibility with Android apps, the added permission
                    toggle is enabled by default. However, the OS app installation UI has been
                    extended to show the toggle as part of the installation confirmation page so
                    users can disable it when installing an app.</p>

                    <p>When the Network permission is disabled, GrapheneOS pretends the network is
                    down. It shows the network as down in various APIs, returns errors showing a
                    network connectivity issue rather than a revoked permission and avoids running
                    scheduled jobs depending on the network. This results in apps handling it as
                    if the network is down rather than crashing or showing errors from trying to
                    use the network and being unable to do it.</p>

                    by existing Android permissions (Camera, Microphone, Body Sensors, Activity
                    Recognition) including an accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, barometer,
                    thermometer and any other sensors present on a given device. When access is
                    disabled, apps receive zeroed data when they check for sensor values and don't
                    receive events. GrapheneOS creates an easy to disable notification when apps
                    try to access sensors blocked by the permission being denied. This makes the
                    feature more usable since users can tell if the app is trying to access this
                    functionality.</p>

                    <p>To avoid breaking compatibility with Android apps, the added permission is
                    enabled by default. When an app attempts to access sensors and receives zeroed
                    data due to being denied, GrapheneOS creates a notification which can be
                    easily disabled. The Sensors permission can be set to be disabled by default

                    standard Android storage permissions. Instead of granting storage permissions,
                    users can enable Storage Scopes to make the app assume that it has all storage
                    permissions that it asked for. On Android, an app that doesn't have any storage
                    permissions is still allowed to create files and directories, and is allowed to
                    access the files that it created. Users can optionally add files and directories
                    as storage scopes to permit the app to access files created by other apps.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS supports per-connection MAC randomization and enables it by
                    default. This is a more private approach than the standard persistent
                    per-network random MAC used by modern Android.</p>

                    <p>When the per-connection MAC randomization added by GrapheneOS is being
                    used, DHCP client state is flushed before reconnecting to a network to avoid
                    revealing that it's likely the same device as before.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also applies fixes for serious flaws with the Linux kernel IPv6
                    privacy address implementation which allow using it as an identifier not just
                    for connections to the same network but also across different networks. We
                    don't need to apply these changes for the Pixel 6 and later since this was
                    fixed in the Linux kernel upstream, but hasn't been backported to earlier

                    build/version information (<code>android.os.Build.DISPLAY</code>). It's the

                    <p>On Android, each screenshot also includes EXIF tags with the local date,

                    primarily exists to significantly improve protection against exploitation.
                    However, it also improves privacy. On a device without our secure application
                    spawning system, the secrets used for probabilistic exploit mitigations such
                    as ASLR are usable as device identifiers persisting until reboot. This is an
                    easy way to identify the device from apps in different profiles. It's a minor
                    bonus of the feature and there are still plenty of side channels to identify
                    devices across apps, but it fixes most of the known direct identifier
                    leaks.</p>

                    checks, attestation key provisioning and GNSS almanac downloads along with
                    adding proper support for disabling network time connections. This combines
                    with other toggles to allow making a GrapheneOS device appear to be an AOSP
                    device. This is only particularly important for connectivity checks since the
                    other connections get routed through a VPN which is needed to blend in on a
                    local network in practice.</p>

                    unlock by intentionally failing to unlock 5 times with a different finger.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also adds support for using the fingerprint scanner only for
                    authentication in apps and unlocking hardware keystore keys by toggling off
                    support for unlocking. This feature already existed for the standard Android
                    face unlock feature.</p>

                    <p>Android's user profiles are isolated workspaces with their own instances of
                    apps, app data and profile data (contacts, media store, home directory, etc.).
                    Apps can't see the apps in other user profiles and can only communicate with
                    apps within the same user profile (with mutual consent with the other app).
                    Each user profile has their own encryption keys based on their lock method.
                    They're a great fit for GrapheneOS with a lot of room for improvement.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS provides improvements to user profile functionality and is
                    working on further improvements to make switching between them and monitoring
                    other profiles much more convenient.</p>

                        <p>GrapheneOS raises the limit on the number of secondary user profiles to 32
                        (31 + guest) instead of only 4 (3 + guest) to make this feature much more
                        flexible.</p>

                        <p>GrapheneOS also enables support for logging out of user profiles without
                        needing a device manager controlling the device to use this feature. Logging
                        out makes profiles inactive so none of the apps installed in them can run. It
                        also purges the disk encryption keys from memory and hardware registers,
                        putting the user profile back at rest.</p>

                        secondary user app installation. You can install the apps you want to be
                        usable in a secondary user and then disable the ability to install more apps
                        as that user in the Owner profile. Android supports this as a standard device
                        management feature but doesn't make it available to a user who owns their own
                        device.</p>

                        install packages that are available in other users. This allows installing
                        an app in a secondary user that's already installed in the Owner user
                        without needing to download it again. This helps a lot with using the

                    <p>GrapheneOS includes our Vanadium browser as WebView implementation provided
                    by the OS and our default browser. Vanadium is a hardened variant of Chromium
                    providing enhanced privacy and security, similar to how GrapheneOS compares to
                    AOSP. The Vanadium browser currently doesn't add many features but there are a
                    lot of enhancements planned in the long term.</p>

                    <p>Some of the features added compared to standard mobile Chromium:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Type-based Control Flow Integrity (CFI)</li>
                        <li>Hardware memory tagging (MTE) enabled for the main allocator</li>
                        <li>Strict site isolation and sandboxed iframes</li>
                        <li>JavaScript JIT disabled by default with per-site override option</li>
                        <li>Native Android autofill implementation to avoid needing sandboxed Google
                        Play for autofill support</li>
                        <li>WebGPU disabled for attack surface reduction</li>
                        <li>WebRTC IP handling policy toggle to control peer-to-peer WebRTC mode</li>
                        <li>Compiler hardening: automatic variable initialization, strong stack protector, well defined signed overflow</li>
                        <li>High performance content filtering engine using EasyList + EasyPrivacy
                        with a per-site override option</li>
                        <li>More complete state partitioning without origin trial opt-out</li>
                        <li>High entropy client hints replaced with the frozen user agent values to avoid leaking device/OS info</li>
                        <li>Battery API always shows the battery as charging and at 100% capacity</li>
                        <li>Trivial subdomain hiding disabled</li>
                        <li>Consistent browser behavior across users without usage of feature flags and seed-based trials</li>
                        <li>Nearly all remote services disabled by default or removed. Only connects
                        to GrapheneOS servers by default. There are only 2 default services:
                        component updates such as certificate authority and certificate revocation
                        updates and DNS-over-HTTPS connectivity checks when enabled</li>
                        <li>Web search and global search intents to replace the need for an OS
                        search app</li>
                        <li>Option to always open links from other apps, custom tabs and search
                        intents in Incognito mode</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Better default settings, including non-user-facing flags:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce Accept-Language header by default (only available via
                        chrome://flags)</li>
                        <li>Third party cookies disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Payment support disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Website background sync disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Sensors access disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Protected media (DRM) disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Hyperlink auditing disabled by default</li>
                        <li>Do Not Track enabled by default mainly to avoid users differentiating
                        themselves from others by enabling it since it has no real value</li>
                        <li>WebRTC IP handling policy set to the most private value by default
                        instead of the least private value (turned into a user-facing option by
                        Vanadium)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Configurable features such as JS JIT disabling and content filtering are
                    currently exclusive to the Vanadium browser. Vanadium WebView is currently
                    excluded from these changes until it has an app setting configuration menu
                    similar to the standard site setting configuration menu.</p>

                    <p>Extension support isn't planned due to being at odds with site isolation and
                    anti-fingerprinting. We plan to implement more features as part of the browser
                    with a focus on privacy and security improvements which can be active by default
                    rather than opt-in niche features. Improvements will generally be opt-out on a
                    per-site basis rather than opt-in to provide privacy and security by default and
                    to avoid users making themselves more identifiable by opting into privacy and
                    security features. Default-disabled JS JIT and default-enabled content filtering
                    are early examples of this approach we plan to expand upon.</p>

                    <p>We plan to add more site settings toggles related to attack surface reduction
                    such as site setting toggles for WebGL, WebGPU, WebRTC and other features which
                    are normally always enabled. This will help with both security and improving the
                    defenses against fingerprinting.</p>

                    <p>Anti-fingerprinting depends on having a large userbase with the same browser,
                    extensions, content filters and other web-facing configuration. Once Vanadium
                    has more features, it will be made available outside GrapheneOS to expand the
                    userbase. Our approach to attack surface reduction eliminates fingerprinting
                    methods in addition to attack surface for exploits and this will be a key part
                    of how we approach preventing fingerprinting by not having features like WebGL,
                    WebGPU and WebRTC exposed in the first place. Good defaults and avoiding having
                    users changing web-facing configuration is an important part of this. Content
                    filters will remain standard across users and updated together as part of the
                    Vanadium configuration app. We'll address the need for language-focused filters
                    by enabling them based on browser language configuration. Fingerprinting based
                    on hardware differences will become more relevant once Vanadium is available
                    outside of GrapheneOS which will always support a small set of highly secure
                    devices.</p>

                    <p>State partitioning still needs to be fully completed. The main remaining
                    hurdle is providing full cookie partitioning. Mainstream browsers with this
                    feature rely on heuristics bypassing cookie partitioning which can be easily
                    abused to bypass the feature. We tried deploying full cookie partitioning by
                    default but had to roll it back and will need to consider how to approach this
                    particularly with our goal of having most Vanadium users using nearly the same
                    configuration.</p>

                    <p>We plan to move to a better content engine with support for more advanced
                    filter rules and cosmetic filtering in the future. Expanding the standard
                    filters will depend on having support for the extensions used by uBlock Origin,
                    AdGuard and other filters.</p>

                    <p>Most browser data is currently excluded from OS backups, which will likely be
                    changed once GrapheneOS has a better backup service included. Export/import for
                    bookmarks and similar data export/import features are also planned. Sync beyond
                    OS backup service support which will eventually provide per-app backup and
                    restore including across devices and via sync services is not planned.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS enables the privacy indicator for location data access in
                    addition to the standard Android camera and microphone indicators. This shows
                    an indicator when an app the user has granted permission to access location
                    requests location data. We also resolve various UX issues with this feature as
                    it currently exists in AOSP to get it into a highly usable state.</p>

                    <p>Android 13 has the location privacy indicator as a developer option but it
                    doesn't work the same way as it does in GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS shows it for
                    all location data accesses through any APIs. Normally, the stock OS only shows
                    it for GNSS location requests, also known as high power location requests, and
                    doesn't normally show it for network location and other APIs gated by the
                    Location permission / global block toggle.</p>

                    <p>The indicator works the same way as the Camera and Microphone ones, showing
                    a bright green icon when location access occurs which then gets minimized to a
                    small bright green dot when the quick settings tray isn't currently opened.
                    Android 12 already includes Location with the other standard runtime
                    permissions in the privacy dashboard for viewing the history.</p>

                    uninstall it and lose their app data. This is much stricter than the standard
                    force stop feature which only prevents an app from starting itself and the app
                    will start running again as soon as another app tries to open an activity or
                    service it provides.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#other-features">Other features</a></h3>

                    <p>This is an incomplete list of other GrapheneOS features.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Per-profile encrypted file name padding increased from 16 bytes to 32
                        bytes to reduce the information leaked through file name lengths. See the
                        FAQ section on <a href="/faq#encryption">the filesystem-based full disk
                        encryption</a> used by modern Android and GrapheneOS for more information.</li>
                        <li>Improved user visibility into persistent firmware security through version
                        and configuration verification with reporting of inconsistencies and debug
                        features being enabled.</li>
                        <li>Authenticated encryption for network time updates via a first party server to
                        prevent attackers from changing the time and enabling attacks based on bypassing
                        certificate / key expiry, etc.</li>
                        <li>Proper support for disabling network time updates rather than just not using
                        the results</li>
                        <li>Hardened local build / signing infrastructure</li>
                        <li><a href="/usage#updates">Seamless automatic OS update system</a> that just
                        works and stays out of the way in the background without disrupting device
                        usage, with full support for the standard automatic rollback if the first boot
                        of the updated OS fails</li>
                        <li>Require unlocking to access sensitive functionality via quick tiles</li>
                        <li><a href="/faq#bundled-apps">Minimal bundled apps and services</a>. Only
                        essential apps are integrated into the OS. We don't make partnerships with
                        apps and services to bundle them into the OS. An app may be the best choice
                        today and poor choice in the future. Our approach will be recommending certain
                        apps during the initial setup, not hard-wiring them into the OS.</li>
                        <li>Wireless alerts are fully optional since GrapheneOS adds a toggle for
                        the otherwise mandatory presidential alert type. This is particularly
                        useful in Canada where the government abuses the system and sends every
                        type of alert as a presidential alert to stop users from being able to opt
                        out of weather and amber alerts.</li>
                        <li>Removal of TrustCor root certificate authority as a trusted system CA.</li>
                        <li>Secure-by-default Android 12 PendingIntent security check (FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
                        instead of crash-by-default improving older app compatibility and security.</li>
                        <li>Fixed UART debugging enabled warning on offical release builds.</li>
                        <li>Engineering / Prototype ("EVT", "PVT" or "DVT") device warning as these
                        devices typically have relaxed security controls for development, mainly
                        the secure boot state property <code>ro.boot.secure_boot</code> not set
                        to <code>PRODUCTION</code>.</li>
                        <li>Enable bootloader, radio, and boot partition version / fingerprint
                        checks.</li>
                        <li>Remove code automatically granting the location permission to system
                        browsers.</li>
                        <li>Apps that don't have any storage permission aren't allowed to read the
                        list of all user-created directories (this is allowed on Android). The list of
                        files is hidden from such apps on both Android and GrapheneOS.</li>
                        <li>Screenshot shutter sound is toggleable using the <b>Tap &amp; click
                        sounds</b> option in <b>Settings&#160;<span aria-label="and
                        then">></span> Sound &amp; vibration</b> while still following
                        the standard method of putting the device on vibration/silent mode to
                        turn off the screenshot shutter sound.</li>
                        <li>More precise system clock via lowering the system clock time update
                        threshold from 2000ms to 50ms and lowering the system clock drift warning
                        from 2000ms to 250ms. This can be helpful for time-based protocols such as
                        TOTP.</li>
                        <li>Call recording functionality within the Dialer app using modern Android
                        storage with recordings stored in Recordings/Call Recordings and no restrictions based
                        on region or special cases like playing a recording tone (users are still responsible
                        for complying with their local laws).</li>
                        <li>Change standard Android package installer behavior to preserving packages being 
                        disabled after updating them instead of them being re-enabled.</li>
