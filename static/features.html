            <h1><a href="#features">Features overview</a></h1>

            <p>GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system with great functionality
            and usability. It starts from the strong baseline of the
            <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project (AOSP)</a> and
            takes great care to avoid increasing attack surface or hurting the strong security
            model. GrapheneOS makes substantial improvements to both privacy and security through
            many carefully designed features built to function against real adversaries. The
            project cares a lot about usability and app compatibility so those are taken into
            account for all of our features.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is focused on substance rather than branding and marketing. It doesn't
            take the typical approach of piling on a bunch of insecure features depending on the
            adversaries not knowing about them and regressing actual privacy/security. It's a very
            technical project building privacy and security into the OS rather than including
            assorted unhelpful frills or bundling subjective third party apps choices.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is also hard at work on filling in gaps from not bundling Google apps
            and services into the OS. We aren't against users using Google services but it doesn't
            belong integrated into the OS in an invasive way. GrapheneOS won't take the shortcut
            of simply bundling a very incomplete and poorly secured third party reimplementation
            of Google services into the OS. That wouldn't ever be something users could rely upon.
            It will also always be chasing a moving target while offering poorer security than the
            real thing if the focus is on simply getting things working without great care for
            doing it robustly and securely.</p>

            <p>This page provides an overview of currently implemented features differentiating
            GrapheneOS from AOSP. It doesn't document our many historical features that are no
            longer included for one reason or another. Many of our features were implemented in
            AOSP, Linux, <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and other projects GrapheneOS is
            based on and those aren't listed here. In many cases, we've been involved in getting
            those features implemented in core infrastructure projects.</p>

                <h2><a href="#grapheneos">GrapheneOS</a></h2>

                <p>These are the features of GrapheneOS beyond what's provided by version 12.1
                of the Android Open Source Project. It only covers our improvements to AOSP and
                not baseline features. This section doesn't list features like the standard app
                sandbox, verified boot, exploit mitigations (ASLR, SSP, Shadow Call Stack,
                Control Flow Integrity, etc.), permission system (foreground-only and one-time
                permission grants, scoped file access control, etc.) and so on but rather only
                our improvements to modern Android. We plan on providing a separate page listing
                the improvements we've contributed to Android since those features aren't listed
                here despite being a substantial portion of our overall historical work.</p>

                <section id="exploit-protection">
                    <h3><a href="#exploit-protection">Defending against exploitation of unknown
                    vulnerabilities</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS is heavily focused on protecting users against attackers
                    exploiting unknown (0 day) vulnerabilities. Patching vulnerabilities doesn't
                    protect users before the vulnerability is known to the vendor and has a patch
                    developed and shipped.</p>

                    <p>Unknown (0 day) vulnerabilities are much more widely used than most realize
                    to exploit users not just in targeted attacks but in broad deployments.
                    Project Zero maintains
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/view#gid=0">a
                    spreadsheet</a> tracking zero day exploitation detected in the wild. This is
                    only a peek into what's happening since it only documents cases where the
                    attackers were caught exploiting users, often because the attacks are not
                    targeted but rather deployed on public websites, etc.</p>

                    <p>The first line of defense is attack surface reduction. Removing unnecessary
                    code or exposed attack surface eliminates many vulnerabilities completely.
                    GrapheneOS avoids removing any useful functionality for end users, but we can
                    still disable lots of functionality by default and require that users opt-in
                    to using it to eliminate it for most of them. An example we landed upstream in
                    Android is disallowing using the kernel's profiling support by default, since
                    it was and still is a major source of Linux kernel vulnerabilities. Profiling
                    is now only exposed to apps for developers who enable developer tools, enable
                    the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and then use profiling tools via ADB. It's also
                    only enabled until the next boot. This isn't listed below since it's one of
                    the features we got implemented in Android itself.</p>

                    <p>The next line of defense is preventing an attacker from exploiting a
                    vulnerability, either by making it impossible, unreliable or at least
                    meaningfully harder to develop. The vast majority of vulnerabilities are well
                    understood classes of bugs and exploitation can be prevented by avoiding the
                    bugs via languages/tooling or preventing exploitation with strong exploit
                    mitigations. In many cases, vulnerability classes can be completely wiped out
                    while in many others they can at least be made meaningfully harder to exploit.
                    Android does a lot of work in this area and GrapheneOS has helped to advance
                    this in Android and the Linux kernel. It takes an enormous amount of resources
                    to develop fundamental fixes for these problems and there's often a high
                    performance, memory or compatibility cost to deploying them. Mainstream
                    operating systems usually don't prioritize security over other areas.
                    GrapheneOS is willing to go further and we offer toggles for users to choose
                    the compromises they prefer instead of forcing it on them. In the meantime,
                    weaker less complete exploit mitigations can still provide meaningful barriers
                    against attacks as long as they're developed with a clear threat model.
                    GrapheneOS is heavily invested in many areas of developing these protections:
                    developing/deploying memory safe languages / libraries, static/dynamic
                    analysis tooling and many kinds of mitigations.</p>

                    <p>The final line of defense is containment through sandboxing at various
                    levels: fine-grained sandboxes around a specific context like per site browser
                    renderers, sandboxes around a specific component like Android's media codec
                    sandbox and app / workspace sandboxes like the Android app sandbox used to
                    sandbox each app which is also the basis for user/work profiles. GrapheneOS
                    improves all of these sandboxes through fortifying the kernel and other base
                    OS components along with improving the sandboxing policies.</p>

                    <p>Preventing an attacker from persisting their control of a component or the
                    OS / firmware through verified boot and avoiding trust in persistent state
                    also helps to mitigate the damage after a compromise has occurred.</p>

                    <p>Remote code execution vulnerabilities are the most serious and allow an
                    attacker to gain a foothold on device or even substantial control over it
                    remotely. Local code execution vulnerabilities allow breaking out of a sandbox
                    including the app sandbox or browser renderer sandbox after either
                    compromising an app / browser renderer remotely, compromising an app's supply
                    chain or getting the user to install a malicious app. Many other kinds of
                    vulnerabilities exist but most of what we're protecting against falls into
                    these 2 broad categories.</p>

                    <p>The vast majority of local and remote code execution vulnerabilities are
                    memory corruption bugs caused by memory unsafe languages or rare low-level
                    unsafe code in an otherwise memory safe language. Most of the remaining issues
                    are caused by dynamic code execution/loading features. Our main focus is on
                    preventing or raising the difficult of exploiting memory corruption bugs
                    followed by restricting dynamic code execution both to make escalation from a
                    memory corruption bug harder and to directly mitigate bugs caused by dynamic
                    code loading/generation/execution such as a JIT compiler bug or a plugin
                    loading vulnerability.</p>

                                    uninitialized data usage vulnerabilities harmless. Without our
                                    changes, memory that's released retains data indefinitely until the
                                    memory is handed out for other uses and gets partially or fully

                        <p>GrapheneOS improves the app sandbox through hardening SELinux policy
                        and seccomp-bpf policy along with all the hardening to components like
                        kernel implementing the app sandbox and providing a path for the attacker
                        to escape it if they can exploit those components. We primarily focus on
                        the app sandbox, but we also improve the other sandboxes including making
                        direct improvements to the web browser renderer sandbox used for both the
                        default browser and WebView rendering engine provided by the OS and used

                    <p>GrapheneOS includes fixes for many vulnerabilities not yet fixed in
                    Android. On modern devices with Generic Kernel Image (GKI) support, we
                    update the kernel to the latest stable GKI release many months before the stock OS
                    gets the update. This means we're shipping hundreds of fixes not included in
                    the stock OS including many security fixes. We also backport more fixes on top
                    of this for the kernel and for other components too.</p>

                    <p>We often find new vulnerabilities ourselves and report them upstream. We've
                    reported dozens of vulnerabilities for both the generic Android codebase and
                    also for Pixels specifically. We also often find missed patches which were
                    supposed to be included but were missed, especially when there are device
                    specific components with partially shared but separate codebases for different
                    devices.</p>

                    <p>Our overall approach is to focus on systemic privacy and security
                    improvements but fixing individual vulnerabilities is still very
                    important.</p>

                <section id="sandboxed-google-play">
                    <h3><a href="#sandboxed-google-play">Sandboxed Google Play</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS has a compatibility layer providing the option to install and use
                    the official releases of Google Play in the standard app sandbox. Google Play
                    receives absolutely no special access or privileges on GrapheneOS as opposed to
                    bypassing the app sandbox and receiving a massive amount of highly privileged
                    access. Instead, the compatibility layer teaches it how to work within the full
                    app sandbox. It also isn't used as a backend for the OS services as it would be
                    elsewhere since GrapheneOS doesn't use Google Play even when it's installed.</p>

                    <p>Since the Google Play apps are simply regular apps on GrapheneOS, you install
                    them within a specific user or work profile and they're only available within that
                    profile. Only apps within the same profile can use it and they need to explicitly
                    choose to use it. It works the same way as any other app and has no special
                    capabilities. As with any other app, it can't access data of other apps and
                    requires explicit user consent to gain access to profile data or the standard
                    permissions. Apps within the same profile can communicate with mutual consent and
                    it's no different for sandboxed Google Play.</p>

                    <p>Sandboxed Google Play is close to being fully functional and provides near
                    complete compatibility with the app ecosystem depending on Google Play. Only a
                    small subset of privileged functionality which we haven't yet ported to
                    different approaches with our compatibility layer is unavailable. Some
                    functionality is inherently privileged and can't be provided as part of the
                    compatibility layer.</p>

                    <p>The vast majority of Play services functionality works perfectly including
                    dynamically downloaded / updated modules (dynamite modules) and functionality
                    provided by modular app components such as Google Play Games. By default,
                    location requests are rerouted to a partial implementation of the Play
                    geolocation service provided by GrapheneOS. You can disable rerouting and use
                    the full Play services geolocation service instead.</p>

                    <p>Our compatibility layer includes full support for the Play Store. Play
                    Store services are fully available including in-app purchases, Play Asset
                    Delivery, Play Feature Delivery and app / content license checks. It can
                    install, update and uninstall apps with the standard approach requiring that
                    the user authorizes it as an app source and consents to each action. It will
                    use the standard Android 12+ unattended update feature to do automatic updates
                    for apps where it was the last installer. Unattended updates by sandboxed apps
                    are throttled and it can hit the limit when installing batches of updates and
                    request consent. We plan to improve this in the future by teaching it to try
                    an unattended update again after a short wait.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS adds a Network permission toggle for disallowing both direct and
                    indirect access to any of the available networks. The device-local network
                    (localhost) is also guarded by this permission, which is important for
                    preventing apps from using it to communicate between profiles. Unlike a
                    firewall-based implementation, the Network permission toggle prevents apps
                    from using the network via APIs provided by the OS or other apps in the same
                    profile as long as they're marked appropriately.</p>

                    <p>The standard INTERNET permission used as the basis for the Network
                    permission toggle is enhanced with a second layer of enforcement and proper
                    support for granting/revoking it on a per-profile basis.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS supports per-connection MAC randomization and enables it by
                    default. This is a more private approach than the standard persistent
                    per-network random MAC used by modern Android.</p>

                    <p>When the per-connection MAC randomization added by GrapheneOS is being
                    used, DHCP client state is flushed before reconnecting to a network to avoid
                    revealing that it's likely the same device as before.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also applies fixes for serious flaws with the Linux kernel IPv6
                    privacy address implementation which allow using it as an identifier not just
                    for connections to the same network but also across different networks. We
                    don't need to apply these changes for the Pixel 6 and later since this was
                    fixed in the Linux kernel upstream, but hasn't been backported to earlier
                    kernel LTS branches so we still need to take care of it there.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS disables the inclusion of sensitive metadata in screenshots.</p>

                    <p>On Android, each screenshot includes an EXIF Software tag with detailed OS
                    build/version information (<code>android.os.Build.DISPLAY</code>). It's the
                    same value shown at Settings ➔ About device ➔ Build number. This leaks the OS,
                    OS version and also usually the device family/model since builds are usually
                    specific to a family of devices. GrapheneOS completely disables this tag.</p>

                    <p>On Android, each screenshot also includes EXIF tags with the local date,
                    time and timezone offset. GrapheneOS disables this by default in order to
                    avoid leaking the time and quasi-location information through metadata that
                    isn't visible to the user. The date and time are already included in the file
                    name of the screenshot which is fully visible to the user and can be easily
                    modified by them without a third party tool. GrapheneOS includes a toggle for
                    turning this metadata back on in Settings ➔ Privacy since some users may find
                    it to be useful.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS fixes several prominent device identifier leaks bypassing
                    Android's intention of apps not being able to uniquely identify a device. See
                    our FAQ sections on <a href="/faq#hardware-identifiers">hardware

                    identifiers</a> for more general information.</p>

                    <p>Our <a href="/usage#exec-spawning">secure application spawning system</a>
                    primarily exists to significantly improve protection against exploitation.
                    However, it also improves privacy. On a device without our secure application
                    spawning system, the secrets used for probabilistic exploit mitigations such
                    as ASLR are usable as device identifiers persisting until reboot. This is an
                    easy way to identify the device from apps in different profiles. It's a minor
                    bonus of the feature and there are still plenty of side channels to identify
                    devices across apps, but it fixes most of the known direct identifier
                    leaks.</p>

                    <p>We also eliminate several holes in preventing apps from accessing hardware
                    identifiers including tightening up the restrictions for apps targeting legacy
                    Android platform versions.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS doesn't include or use Google apps and services by default and
                    avoids including any other apps/services not aligned with our privacy and
                    security focus. Google apps and services can be used on GrapheneOS as regular

                    href="#sandboxed-google-play">sandboxed Google Play</a> feature, but we don't
                    include those apps by default to give users an explicit choice on whether they
                    want to use those apps and which profiles they want to use it in.</p>

                    <p>We change the default settings to prefer privacy over small conveniences:
                    personalized keyboard suggestions based on gathering input history are
                    disabled by default, sensitive notifications are hidden on the lockscreen by
                    default and passwords are hidden during entry by default.</p>

                    <p>Some of our changes for <a href="#attack-surface-reduction">attack surface
                    reduction</a> can also improve privacy by default by not exposing unnecessary
                    radios, etc. by default and avoiding the impact of potential privacy bugs with
                    the hardware.</p>

                    <p>By default, we also use GrapheneOS servers for the following services
                    instead of Google servers:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Connectivity checks</li>
                        <li>Attestation key provisioning</li>
                        <li>GNSS almanac downloads (PSDS) on 6th generation Pixels</li>
                        <li>Network time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We provide a toggle to switch back to Google's servers for connectivity
                    checks, attestation key provisioning and GNSS almanac downloads along with
                    adding proper support for disabling network time connections. This combines
                    with other toggles to allow making a GrapheneOS device appear to be an AOSP
                    device. This is only particularly important for connectivity checks since the
                    other connections get routed through a VPN which is needed to blend in on a
                    local network in practice.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS improves the security of the fingerprint unlock feature by only
                    permitting 5 total attempts rather than implementing a 30 second delay between
                    every 5 failed attempts with a total of 20 attempts. This doesn't just reduce
                    the number of potential attempts but also makes it easy to disable fingerprint
                    unlock by intentionally failing to unlock 5 times with a different finger.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also adds support for using the fingerprint scanner only for
                    authentication in apps and unlocking hardware keystore keys by toggling off

                    <p>Android's user profiles are isolated workspaces with their own instances of
                    apps, app data and profile data (contacts, media store, home directory, etc.).
                    Apps can't see the apps in other user profiles and can only communicate with
                    apps within the same user profile (with mutual consent with the other app).
                    Each user profile has their own encryption keys based on their lock method.
                    They're a great fit for GrapheneOS with a lot of room for improvement.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS provides improvements to user profile functionality and is

                        also purges the disk encryption keys from memory and hardware registers,

                    a bright green icon when location access occurs which then gets minimized to a
                    small bright green dot when the quick settings tray isn't currently opened.
                    Android 12 already includes Location with the other standard runtime
                    permissions in the privacy dashboard for viewing the history.</p>

                    <p>This will likely become a standard feature in Android 13 at which point it
                    will be removed from this page.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#user-installed-apps-can-be-disabled">User installed apps can be disabled</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS adds support for disabling user installed apps instead of only
                    being able to disable system apps. This allows users to completely prevent one
                    of the apps they've installed from being able to run without being forced to
                    uninstall it and lose their app data. This is much stricter than the standard
                    force stop feature which only prevents an app from starting itself and the app
                    will start running again as soon as another app tries to open an activity or
                    service it provides.</p>

                    <p>This is an incomplete list of other GrapheneOS features.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Low-level improvements to the <a href="/faq#encryption">filesystem-based
                        full disk encryption</a> used on modern Android</li>
                        <li>Improved user visibility into persistent firmware security through version
                        and configuration verification with reporting of inconsistencies and debug
                        features being enabled.</li>
                        <li>Authenticated encryption for network time updates via a first party server to
                        prevent attackers from changing the time and enabling attacks based on bypassing
                        certificate / key expiry, etc.</li>
                        <li>Proper support for disabling network time updates rather than just not using
                        the results</li>
                        <li>Hardened local build / signing infrastructure</li>
                        <li><a href="/usage#updates">Seamless automatic OS update system</a> that just
                        works and stays out of the way in the background without disrupting device
                        usage, with full support for the standard automatic rollback if the first boot
                        of the updated OS fails</li>
                        <li>Require unlocking to access sensitive functionality via quick tiles</li>
                        <li><a href="/faq#bundled-apps">Minimal bundled apps and services</a>. Only
                        essential apps are integrated into the OS. We don't make partnerships with
                        apps and services to bundle them into the OS. An app may be the best choice
                        today and poor choice in the future. Our approach will be recommending certain
                        apps during the initial setup, not hard-wiring them into the OS.</li>
