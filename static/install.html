            </h2>
            <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available.</p>
            <p>You need the unlocked variant of one of the supported devices, not a locked carrier
            specific variant.</p>
            <p>It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running
            the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running
            into bugs in older firmware versions. It's known that the early Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL
            bootloader versions have weird quirks with unlocking. There aren't known issues on
            other devices, but this is still a good idea. You can either do this via over-the-air
            updates or sideload a full update from their
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">full update package page</a>.</p>
            <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and it needs to be
            included in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot
            --version</code> to determine the current version. It should be at least
            <code>28.0.0</code>. Don't proceed with the installation process until this is set up
            properly in your current shell. A very common mistake is using an outdated copy of
            <code>fastboot</code> from a Linux distribution package not receiving regular updates.
            Make sure that the <code>fastboot</code> found earliest in your <code>PATH</code> is
            the correct one if you have multiple copies on your system. You can run <code>which
            fastboot</code> to determine where the tool being used is coming from. Older versions
            do not have support for current devices. Very old versions of <code>fastboot</code>
            from several years ago are still shipped by Linux distributions like Debian and lack
            the compatibility detection of modern versions so they can soft brick devices.</p>

            <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>
            <p>Enable the developer settings menu by going to Settings ➔ System ➔ About phone and

            <p>First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the
            device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.</p>
            <p>The bootloader now needs to be unlocked to allow flashing new images:</p>
            <pre>fastboot flashing unlock</pre>
            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device.</p>

            <p>The initial install will be performed by flashing the factory images. This will
            replace the existing OS installation and wipe all the existing data.</p>
            <p>You can download the factory images from <a href="/releases">the releases page</a>.</p>
            <p>Verify the official factory images using the GPG signature:</p>

gpg --verify blueline-factory-2019.04.01.19.zip.sig blueline-factory-2019.04.01.19.zip</pre>
            <p>When this signing key is replaced, the new key will be signed with it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Reboot into the bootloader menu to begin the flashing procedure.</p>
            <p>Next, extract the factory images and run the script to flash them. Note that the
            <code>fastboot</code> command run by the flashing script requires a fair bit of free
            space in a temporary directory, which defaults to <code>/tmp</code>:<p>
            <pre>unzip blueline-factory-2019.04.01.19.zip
cd blueline-pq2a.190405.003
./flash-all.sh</pre>
            <p>Use a different temporary directory if your <code>/tmp</code> doesn't have enough
            space available:</p>
            <pre>mkdir tmp
TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh</pre>
            <p>Wait for the flashing process to complete and for the device to boot up using the
            new operating system.</p>
            <p>You should now proceed to locking the bootloader before using the device as locking
            wipes the data again.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
            prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
            detect modifications to any of the OS partitions (vbmeta, boot/dtbo, product, system,
            vendor) and it will prevent reading any modified / corrupted data. If changes are
            detected, error correction data is used to attempt to obtain the original data at
            which point it's verified again which makes verified boot robust to non-malicious
            corruption.</p>
            <p>Reboot into the bootloader menu and set it to locked:</p>
            <pre>fastboot flashing lock</pre>
            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device since it needs to perform a factory
            reset.</p>
            <p>Unlocking the bootloader again will perform a factory reset.</p>

            <p>OEM unlocking can be disabled again in the developer settings menu within the

            <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
            hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
            are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
            OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
            images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
            GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
            Auditor mode. The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and
            has pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
            However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification via the
            attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting the device to the
            network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which stops being possible
            after the initial verification). Further protection against proxying the initial
            pairing will be provided in the future via optional support for ID attestation to
            include the serial number in the hardware verified information to allow checking
            against the one on the box / displayed in the bootloader. See the
            <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a> for a guide.</p>
            <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
            against between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
            cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
            device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
            also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>

                Replacing GrapheneOS with the stock OS
                <a href="#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os">¶</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process
            described above. However, before locking, there's an additional step to fully revert
            the device to a clean factory state on modern devices with Android Verified Boot 2.0
            (AVB) like the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. It isn't necessary for
            devices with legacy verified boot like the Pixel and Pixel XL.</p>
            <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
            needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. After flashing the
            stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
            Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
            <pre>fastboot erase avb_custom_key</pre>
