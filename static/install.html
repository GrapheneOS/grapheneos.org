            <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available.</p>

            <p>Windows 10, macOS Catalina, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the
            officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS. You should make sure
            your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding with these instructions. Older
            versions and other Linux distributions usually work, but if you encounter problems try
            using one of the officially supported options.</p>

            <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
            be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
            variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
            flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
            carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
            bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
            support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
            device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
            carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id and
            it's otherwise the same.</p>

            <p>It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running
            the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running
            into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. You can
            either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for
            Pixel phones can be obtained from the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">full update package page</a>.</p>

            <p>These instructions use command-line tools. On Windows, use PowerShell rather than
            the legacy Command Prompt.</p>

            <h3 id="obtaining-fastboot">
                <a href="#obtaining-fastboot">Obtaining fastboot</a>
            </h3>

            <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and it needs to be
            included in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot
            --version</code> to determine the current version. It must be at least
            <code>29.0.6</code>. You can use a distribution package for this, but most of them
            mistakenly package development snapshots of fastboot, clobber the standard version
            scheme for platform-tools (adb, fastboot, etc.) with their own scheme and don't keep
            it up-to-date despite that being crucial.</p>

            <p>List of distribution packages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Arch Linux: <code>android-tools</code> provides fastboot and other useful
                    tools not required for installation such as adb. <code>android-udev</code>
                    provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions
                    without root.</li>
                <li>Debian and Ubuntu: <code>android-sdk-platform-tools-common</code> provides
                    udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root.
                    The udev rules in Debian and Ubuntu are out-of-date, but it has the necessary
                    entries for Pixel phones. The adb and fastboot packages are currently both
                    broken and far too out-of-date to be any use, so avoid those. The version
                    check in the flashing script will prevent accidentally using these.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="standalone-platform-tools">
                <a href="#standalone-platform-tools">Standalone platform-tools</a>
            </h4>

            <p>If your operating system doesn't make a proper version of fastboot available,
            consider using the
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">standalone
            releases of platform-tools from Google</a>. If you have the Android SDK or intend to
            do development work, you install the platform-tools package via the Android SDK
            package manager which can be used to keep it up-to-date. The Android SDK is available
            by itself or can be obtained via Android Studio.</p>

            <p>To download, verify and extract the standalone platform-tools on Linux:</p>

            <pre>curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
echo 'd6d72d006c03bd55d49b6cef9f00295db02f0a31da10e121427e1f4cb43e7cb9  platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip' | sha256sum -c
unzip platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip</pre>

            <p>To download, verify and extract the standalone platform-tools on macOS:</p>

            <pre>curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/eabcd8b4b7ab518c6af9c941af8494072f17ec4b.platform-tools_r30.0.5-darwin.zip
echo 'SHA256 (eabcd8b4b7ab518c6af9c941af8494072f17ec4b.platform-tools_r30.0.5-darwin.zip) = e5780bad71a53cf9d693e1053a0748f49e4a67cc1f71d16a94ab4c943af3345f' | shasum -c
tar xvf fbad467867e935dce68a0296b00e6d1e76f15b15.platform-tools_r30.0.5-darwin.zip</pre>

            <p>To download, verify and extract the standalone platform-tools on Windows:</p>

            <pre>curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
(Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip).hash -eq "549ba2bdc31f335eb8a504f005f77606a479cc216d6b64a3e8b64c780003661f"
tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip</pre>

            <p>Next, add the tools to your <code>PATH</code> in the current shell so they can be
            used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script.</p>

            <p>On Linux and macOS:</p>

            <pre>export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"</pre>

            <p>On Windows:</p>

            <pre>$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"</pre>

            <p>Sample output from <code>fastboot --version</code> afterwards:</p>

            <pre>fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
Installed as /home/username/downloads/platform-tools/fastboot</pre>

            <p>This is a temporary change to <code>PATH</code> for the current shell and will need
            to be done again if you open a new terminal. Make sure that the <code>fastboot</code>
            command works in the current shell before trying to run the flashing script.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>To verify the download of the OS beyond the security offered by HTTPS, you can use
            the signify tool. If you do not have a way to obtain signify from a package repository
            you're already trusting, it does not make sense to use it. GrapheneOS releases are
            hosted on our servers and we do not have third party mirrors. A compromised signify
            would be able to compromise your OS and the GrapheneOS download due to the lack of an
            application security model on traditional operating systems. It would be worse than
            not trying to verify the signatures. It's far less likely that our servers would be
            compromised than someone's GitHub account or GitHub itself. You're already trusting
            these installation instructions from our site, which is hosted on the same static web
            server infrastructure as the releases.</p>

            <p>List of distribution packages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Arch Linux: <code>signify</code></li>
                <li>Debian: <code>signify-openbsd</code> with the command renamed to <code>signify-openbsd</code></li>
                <li>Ubuntu: <code>signify-openbsd</code> with the command renamed to <code>signify-openbsd</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>On Debian-based distributions, the <code>signify</code> package and command are an
            <a href="http://signify.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">unmaintained mail-related
            tool for generating mail signatures (not cryptographic signatures)</a> with the final
            releases from 2003-2004 made directly by the developer via the Debian package without
            upstream releases. Please pressure them to correct this usability issue.</p>

            </h2>

            <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

            <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and
            pressing on the build number menu entry until developer mode is enabled.</p>

            <p>Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer options and toggle on the
            'Enable OEM unlocking' setting. This requires internet access on devices with Google

            <p>First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the
            device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.</p>

            <p>Unlock the bootloader to allow flashing the OS and firmware:</p>

            <pre>fastboot flashing unlock</pre>

            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data.</p>

            <p>You need to obtain the GrapheneOS factory images for your device to proceed with
            the installation process.</p>

            <p>You can either download the files with your browser or using a command like
            <code>curl</code>. It's generally easier to use the command-line since you're already
            using it for the rest of the installation process, so these instructions use
            <code>curl</code>.</p>

            <p>On Windows, remove PowerShell's legacy curl alias for the current shell to avoid
            needing to reference it as <code>curl.exe</code> instead of <code>curl</code>:</p>

            <pre>Remove-Item Alias:Curl</pre>

            <p>Download <a href="https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub">the factory images

            When the current signing key is replaced, the new key will be signed with it.</p>

            <p>Download the factory images for the device from <a href="/releases">the releases
            page</a>. For example, to download the 2020.11.05.18 release for the Pixel 4a (sunfish):</p>

            <pre>curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2020.11.05.18.zip
curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2020.11.05.18.zip.sig</pre>

            <p>Verify the factory images using the signature if you were able to obtain
            <code>signify</code> from trusted package repositories (see above):</p>

            <pre>signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2020.11.05.18.zip.sig &amp;&amp; echo verified</pre>

            <p>This will output <code>verified</code> if verification is successful. If something
            goes wrong, it will output an error message rather than <code>verified</code>.</p>

            <p>The initial install will be performed by flashing the factory images. This will

            <p>Reboot into the bootloader interface to begin the flashing procedure.</p>

            <p>A common issue on Linux distributions is that they mount the default temporary file
            directory <code>/tmp</code> as tmpfs which results in it being backed by memory and
            swap rather than persistent storage. By default, the size is 50% of the available
            virtual memory. This is often not enough for the flashing process, especially since
            <code>/tmp</code> is shared between applications and users. To use a different
            temporary directory if your <code>/tmp</code> doesn't have enough space available:</p>

            <pre>mkdir tmp
TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh</pre>

            <p>A majority of failed flashes tend to be caused by substandard USB connectors,
            plugging in via hubs or bad cables which aren't properly up to the USB standard. The
            scrollback from a failed flash will contain valuable diagnostic information which
            is essential in knowing where and how the process went wrong.</p>

            often aren't implemented properly or are broken in subtle ways, which may cause flashing
            to fail even on a USB port that works for other peripherals. Older Linux kernels that
            predate version 5 may have inadequate or patchwork support for USB C or USB 3. If you
            are installing from a Linux distribution, ensure your distribution uses a modern
            kernel.</p>

            <p>Always use a high quality USB A to USB C cable with a rear USB port directly on your
            motherboard, and never use a USB hub for flashing. <em>Never install from a virtual
            machine;</em> USB passthrough in software emulation may be broken or inadequate and this
            can cause the flashing to fail.</p>

            </h2>

            <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
            prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
            detect modifications to any of the OS partitions (vbmeta, boot/dtbo, product, system,
            vendor) and it will prevent reading any modified / corrupted data. If changes are
            detected, error correction data is used to attempt to obtain the original data at
            which point it's verified again which makes verified boot robust to non-malicious
            corruption.</p>

            <p>In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:</p>

            <pre>fastboot flashing lock</pre>

            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device since it needs to perform a factory
            reset.</p>

            <p>Unlocking the bootloader again will perform a factory reset.</p>

            <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
            hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
            are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
            OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
            images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
            GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
            Auditor mode. The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and
            has pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
            However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification via the
            attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting the device to the
            network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which stops being possible
            after the initial verification). Further protection against proxying the initial
            pairing will be provided in the future via optional support for ID attestation to
            include the serial number in the hardware verified information to allow checking
            against the one on the box / displayed in the bootloader. See the
            <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a> for a guide.</p>

            <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
            against between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
            cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
            device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
            also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>

            </h2>

            <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process
            described above. However, before locking, there's an additional step to fully revert
            the device to a clean factory state.</p>

            <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
            needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. After flashing the
            stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
            Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
