            <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available.</p>
            <p>You need the unlocked variant of one of the supported devices, not a locked carrier
            specific variant.</p>
            <p>It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running
            the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running
            into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. Early
            Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL bootloader versions use a non-standard unlocking system not
            covered by these installation instructions. You can either update the device via
            over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for Pixel phones can be obtained
            from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">full update package
            page</a>.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and it needs to be
            included in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot
            --version</code> to determine the current version. It should be at least
            <code>28.0.2</code>. You can use a distribution package for this, but most of them
            mistakenly package development snapshots of fastboot, clobber the standard version
            scheme for platform-tools (adb, fastboot, etc.) with their own scheme and don't keep
            it up-to-date despite that being crucial.</p>

            <p>List of distributions with proper packages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Arch Linux: <code>android-tools</code> for fastboot (along with adb and other
                    tools, although they aren't necessary to install) and
                    <code>android-udev</code> for udev rules to make fastboot / adb work in local
                    sessions without root</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If your distribution doesn't have a proper fastboot package, which is likely,
            consider using the official releases of platform-tools from Google. You can either
            obtain these as part of the standalone SDK or Android Studio which are self-updating
            or via the standalone platform-tools releases. For one time usage, it's easiest to
            obtain the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">latest
            standalone platform-tools release</a>, extract it and add it to your <code>PATH</code>
            in the current shell. For example:</p>

            <pre>unzip platform-tools_r29.0.5-linux.zip
export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"</pre>

            <p>Sample output from <code>fastboot --version</code> afterwards:</p>

            <pre>fastboot version 29.0.5-5949299
Installed as /home/username/downloads/platform-tools/fastboot</pre>

            <p>Don't proceed with the installation process until this is set up properly in your
            current shell. A very common mistake is using an outdated copy of
            <code>fastboot</code> from a Linux distribution package not receiving regular updates.
            Make sure that the <code>fastboot</code> found earliest in your <code>PATH</code> is
            the correct one if you have multiple copies on your system. The <code>fastboot
            --version</code> output includes the installation path for the copy of
            <code>fastboot</code> that's being used. Older versions of fastboot do not have support
            for current devices and OS versions. Very old versions of <code>fastboot</code> from
            are still shipped by Linux distributions like Debian and lack the compatibility
            detection of modern versions so they can soft brick devices.</p>

            <h3 id="obtaining-signify">
                <a href="#obtaining-signify">Obtaining signify</a>
            </h3>

            <p>To verify the download of the OS beyond the security offered by HTTPS, you need the
            signify tool. If you don't have a way to obtain signify from a trusted package
            repository, such as on Windows, skip the additional verification. This is an important
            step, but it only makes sense if you can chain trust from your existing OS
            install.</p>

            <p>On many distributions, signify is available via a <code>signify</code> package in
            the official repositories. On Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, the package and
            command name were renamed to <code>signify-openbsd</code>. Following Debian tradition,
            the <code>signify</code> package and command are an <a
            href="http://signify.sourceforge.net/">unmaintained mail-related tool for generating
            mail signatures (not cryptographic signatures) with the final 3 releases from
            2003-2004 made directly by the developer via the Debian package without upstream
            releases</a>. This is clearly not what you want, but it's easy to end up trying to use
            it instead of <code>signify-openbsd</code>.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Reboot into the bootloader interface to begin the flashing procedure.</p>
            <p>Next, extract the factory images and run the script to flash them. Note that the
            <code>fastboot</code> command run by the flashing script requires a fair bit of free
            space in a temporary directory, which defaults to <code>/tmp</code>:<p>
            <pre>unzip crosshatch-factory-2019.06.23.05.zip
cd crosshatch-pq3a.190605.003
./flash-all.sh</pre>
            <p>Use a different temporary directory if your <code>/tmp</code> doesn't have enough
            space available:</p>
            <pre>mkdir tmp
TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh</pre>
            <p>Wait for the flashing process to complete and for the device to boot up using the
            new operating system.</p>
            <p>You should now proceed to locking the bootloader before using the device as locking
            wipes the data again.</p>
            <p>On current generation devices like the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a
            XL, you'll need to reboot from the userspace fastbootd mode to the bootloader.</p>
            <h2 id="locking-the-bootloader">
                <a href="#locking-the-bootloader">Locking the bootloader</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
            prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
            detect modifications to any of the OS partitions (vbmeta, boot/dtbo, product, system,
            vendor) and it will prevent reading any modified / corrupted data. If changes are
            detected, error correction data is used to attempt to obtain the original data at
            which point it's verified again which makes verified boot robust to non-malicious
            corruption.</p>
            <p>In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:</p>
            <pre>fastboot flashing lock</pre>
            <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device since it needs to perform a factory
            reset.</p>
            <p>Unlocking the bootloader again will perform a factory reset.</p>
            <h2 id="disabling-oem-unlocking">
                <a href="#disabling-oem-unlocking">Disabling OEM unlocking</a>
            </h2>
            <p>OEM unlocking can be disabled again in the developer settings menu within the
            operating system after booting it up again.</p>

                <a href="#verifying-installation">Verifying installation</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
            hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
            are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
            OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
            images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
            GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
            Auditor mode. The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and
            has pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
            However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification via the
            attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting the device to the
            network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which stops being possible
            after the initial verification). Further protection against proxying the initial
            pairing will be provided in the future via optional support for ID attestation to
            include the serial number in the hardware verified information to allow checking
            against the one on the box / displayed in the bootloader. See the
            <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a> for a guide.</p>
            <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
            against between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
            cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
            device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
            also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process
            described above. However, before locking, there's an additional step to fully revert
            the device to a clean factory state.</p>
            <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
            needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. After flashing the
            stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
            Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
