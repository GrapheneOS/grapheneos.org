            <section id="prerequisites">
                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the
                officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS. You should make sure
                your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding with these instructions. Older
                versions and other Linux distributions usually work, but if you encounter problems try
                using one of the officially supported options.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running
                the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running
                into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. You can
                either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for
                Pixel phones can be obtained from the
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">full update package page</a>.</p>

                <p>These instructions use command-line tools. On Windows, use PowerShell rather
                than the legacy Command Prompt. Open up a single terminal and use it for the whole
                installation process.</p>

                <section id="obtaining-fastboot">
                    <h3><a href="#obtaining-fastboot">Obtaining fastboot</a></h3>

                    <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and the
                    directory containing it needs to be included in the <code>PATH</code>
                    environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot --version</code> to determine
                    the current version. It must be at least <code>29.0.6</code>. You can use a
                    distribution package for this, but most of them mistakenly package development
                    snapshots of fastboot, clobber the standard version scheme for platform-tools
                    (adb, fastboot, etc.) with their own scheme and don't keep it up-to-date
                    despite that being crucial.</p>

                    <p>List of distribution packages:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Arch Linux: <code>android-tools</code> provides fastboot and other useful
                            tools not required for installation such as adb. <code>android-udev</code>
                            provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions
                            without root. Install both of these packages and skip the section
                            below on using the standalone platform-tools releases.</li>
                        <li>Debian and Ubuntu: <code>android-sdk-platform-tools-common</code> provides
                            udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root.
                            The udev rules in Debian and Ubuntu are out-of-date, but it has the necessary
                            entries for Pixel phones. The adb and fastboot packages are currently both
                            broken and far too out-of-date to be any use, so avoid those. The version
                            check in the flashing script will prevent accidentally using these.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <!-- https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools -->

                        <p>If your operating system doesn't include a usable version of fastboot,
                        you can use the official standalone releases of platform-tools. This is
                        our recommendation for most users. The flashing process won't work unless
                        you follow these instructions including setting up PATH.</p>

                        <p>Next, add the tools to your <code>PATH</code> in the current shell so they can be
                        used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script.</p>

                        <p>On Linux and macOS:</p>

                        <pre>export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"</pre>

                        <p>This only changes <code>PATH</code> for the current shell and will need
                        to be done again if you open a new terminal.</p>

                    hosted on our servers and we do not have third party mirrors. A compromised signify
                    would be able to compromise your OS and the GrapheneOS download due to the lack of an
                    application security model on traditional operating systems. It would be worse than
                    not trying to verify the signatures. It's far less likely that our servers would be
                    compromised than someone's GitHub account or GitHub itself. You're already trusting
                    these installation instructions from our site, which is hosted on the same static web

                <p>You need to obtain the GrapheneOS factory images for your device to proceed with
                the installation process.</p>

                <p>You can either download the files with your browser or using a command like
                <code>curl</code>. It's generally easier to use the command-line since you're already
                using it for the rest of the installation process, so these instructions use
                <code>curl</code>.</p>

                <p>On Windows, remove PowerShell's legacy curl alias for the current shell to avoid
                needing to reference it as <code>curl.exe</code> instead of <code>curl</code>:</p>

                <pre>Remove-Item Alias:Curl</pre>

                <p>Download <a href="https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub">the factory images
                public key (factory.pub)</a> in order to verify the factory images:</p>

                <pre>curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub</pre>

                <p>This is the content of <code>factory.pub</code>:</p>

                When the current signing key is replaced, the new key will be signed with it.</p>

                <p>Download the factory images for the device from <a href="/releases">the releases
                page</a>. For example, to download the 2020.12.12.03 release for the Pixel 4a (sunfish):</p>

                <pre>curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip.sig</pre>

                <p>Verify the factory images using the signature if you were able to obtain
                <code>signify</code> from trusted package repositories (see above), otherwise
                continue on to the next section without this:</p>

                <pre>signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip.sig &amp;&amp; echo verified</pre>

                <p>This will output <code>verified</code> if verification is successful. If something
                goes wrong, it will output an error message rather than <code>verified</code>.</p>

                    <p>The text output from a failed attempt at flashing will contain valuable
                    diagnostic information which is essential in knowing where and how the process
                    went wrong. Please provide this information when asking for help on the
                    GrapheneOS IRC / Matrix channel.</p>

                    <p>A common issue on Linux distributions is that they mount the default temporary file
                    directory <code>/tmp</code> as tmpfs which results in it being backed by memory and
                    swap rather than persistent storage. By default, the size is 50% of the available
                    virtual memory. This is often not enough for the flashing process, especially since
                    <code>/tmp</code> is shared between applications and users. To use a different
                    temporary directory if your <code>/tmp</code> doesn't have enough space available:</p>

                    <pre>mkdir tmp

                <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
                prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
                detect modifications to any of the OS partitions and it will prevent reading any
                modified / corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used
                to attempt to obtain the original data at which point it's verified again which
                makes verified boot robust to non-malicious corruption.</p>

                <p>In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:</p>

                    <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
                    hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
                    are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
                    OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
                    images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
                    GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
                    Auditor mode. The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and
                    has pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
                    However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification via the
                    attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting the device to the
                    network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which stops being possible
                    after the initial verification). Further protection against proxying the initial
                    pairing will be provided in the future via optional support for ID attestation to
                    include the serial number in the hardware verified information to allow checking
                    against the one on the box / displayed in the bootloader. See the
                    <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a> for a guide.</p>

                    <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
                    against between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
                    cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
                    device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
                    also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>

                    <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process
                    described above. However, before locking, there's an additional step to fully revert
                    the device to a clean factory state.</p>

                    <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
                    needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. After flashing the
                    stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
                    Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
