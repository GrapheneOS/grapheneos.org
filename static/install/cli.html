            <h1><a href="#cli-install">CLI install guide</a></h1>

            <p>This is a guide on installing GrapheneOS on the
            <a href="/faq#supported-devices">officially supported devices</a>. It can be followed
            for both the <a href="/releases">official releases</a> and <a href="/build">custom
            builds</a>. The <a href="/install/web">web installer</a> is an
            easier approach to installing the official releases via a browser with WebUSB
            support.</p>

            <p>We strongly recommend following these official instructions. The official guide has
            a lot of collaborative effort put into covering all of the edge cases and is regularly
            tested by many people on each supported OS. Following these instructions to the letter
            without skipping, reordering or adding any steps will give you a proper GrapheneOS
            installation unless there's a hardware issue. We strongly recommend against following
            unofficial guides deviating in any way from the official instructions.</p>

            <p>If you have trouble with the installation process, ask for help on the
            <a href="/contact#community">official GrapheneOS chat channel</a>. There are almost
            always people around willing to help with it. Before asking for help, make an attempt
            to follow the guide on your own and then ask for help with anything you get stuck
            on.</p>

                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>Officially supported operating systems for the CLI install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                    <li>Windows 11</li>
                    <li>macOS Big Sur (11)</li>
                    <li>macOS Monterey (12)</li>
                    <li>macOS Ventura (13)</li>
                    <li>Arch Linux</li>
                    <li>Debian 10 (buster)</li>
                    <li>Debian 11 (bullseye)</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 22.10</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>The <a href="/install/web">web installer</a> is more portable and can be used
                from Android, ChromeOS and GrapheneOS itself since it can run anywhere with a
                browser with working WebUSB support.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have
                the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the
                early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early
                in the installation process.</p>

            <section id="enabling-oem-unlocking">
                <h2><a href="#enabling-oem-unlocking">Enabling OEM unlocking</a></h2>

                <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

                <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and
                repeatedly pressing the build number menu entry until developer mode is
                enabled.</p>

                <p>Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Developer options and toggle on the 'OEM
                unlocking' setting. On device model variants (SKUs) which support being sold as
                locked devices by carriers, enabling 'OEM unlocking' requires internet access so
                that the stock OS can check if the device was sold as locked by a carrier.</p>

                <p>For the Pixel 6a, OEM unlocking won't work with the version of the stock OS
                from the factory. You need to update it to the June 2022 release or later via an
                over-the-air update. After you've updated it you'll also need to factory reset
                the device to fix OEM unlocking.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="opening-terminal">
                <h2><a href="#opening-terminal">Opening terminal</a></h2>

                <p>These instructions use command-line tools. Launch the terminal as you would any
                other application. On Windows, launch a regular non-administrator instance of the
                PowerShell terminal. Do not use the legacy Command Prompt or administrator variant
                of PowerShell.</p>

                <p>Use the same terminal for the whole installation process. If you close it,
                you'll lose the setup of the environment for the installation.</p>

                <p>On Windows, run the following command to remove PowerShell's legacy curl alias
                for the current shell to avoid needing to reference it as <code>curl.exe</code>
                instead of <code>curl</code>:</p>

            <section id="obtaining-fastboot">
                <h2><a href="#obtaining-fastboot">Obtaining fastboot</a></h2>

                <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and the
                directory containing it needs to be included in the <code>PATH</code>
                environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot --version</code> to determine
                the current version. It must be at least <code>33.0.3</code>. You can use a
                distribution package for this, but most of them mistakenly package development
                snapshots of fastboot, clobber the standard version scheme for platform-tools
                (adb, fastboot, etc.) with their own scheme and don't keep it up-to-date
                despite that being crucial.</p>

                <p>On Arch Linux, install <code>android-tools</code> and skip the section below on
                using the standalone release of platform-tools from Android:</p>

                <pre>sudo pacman -S android-tools</pre>

                <p>The Arch Linux package must be <code>33.0.3-3</code> or later since earlier
                versions had partially outdated code and therefore didn't work with the Pixel 7
                and Pixel 7 Pro.</p>

                <p>Debian and Ubuntu do not have a usable package for fastboot. Their packages for
                these tools are both broken and many years out-of-date. Follow the instructions
                below for platforms without a proper package.</p>

                <section id="standalone-platform-tools">
                    <h3><a href="#standalone-platform-tools">Standalone platform-tools</a></h3>

                    <!-- https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools -->

                    <p>If your operating system doesn't include a usable version of fastboot,
                    you can use the official standalone releases of platform-tools. This is
                    our recommendation for most users. The flashing process won't work unless
                    you follow these instructions including setting up PATH.</p>

                    <p>To download, verify and extract the standalone platform-tools on Debian and

tar xvf platform-tools_r33.0.3-windows.zip</pre>

                    <p>Next, add the tools to your <code>PATH</code> in the current shell so they can be
                    used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script.</p>

                    <p>On Debian, Ubuntu and macOS:</p>

                    <pre>export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"</pre>

                    <pre>$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"</pre>

                    <p>This only changes <code>PATH</code> for the current shell and will need
                    to be done again if you open a new terminal.</p>

                <p>You need to boot your phone into the bootloader interface. To do this, you need
                to hold the volume down button while the phone boots.</p>

                <p>The easiest approach is to reboot the phone and begin holding the volume down
                button until it boots up into the bootloader interface.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, turn off the phone, then boot it up while holding the volume
                down button during the boot process. You can either boot it with the power button
                or by plugging it in as required in the next section.</p>

                <p>Connect the phone to the computer. On Linux, you'll need to do this again if
                you didn't have the udev rules set up when you connected it.</p>

                <p>On Linux, GNOME has a bug causing compatibility issues with the installation
                process. It wrongly detects the phone in fastboot mode or fastbootd mode as being
                an MTP device and claims exclusive control over it. This will block the install
                process from proceeding. You can run the following command to work around it:</p>

                <pre>echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers_autoprobe</pre>

                <p>After installing, you can undo this by rebooting or by running the following
                command:</p>

                <pre>echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers_autoprobe</pre>

                <p>On Windows, you need to install a driver for fastboot if you don't already have
                it. No driver is needed on other operating systems. You can obtain the driver from
                Windows Update which will detect it as an optional update when the device is
                booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the computer. Open Windows
                Update, run a check for updates and then open the "View optional updates"
                interface. Install the driver for the Android bootloader interface as an optional
                update.</p>

                <p>An alternative approach to obtaining the Windows fastboot driver is to obtain
                the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb">latest driver for
                Pixels</a> from Google and then

                        <p>Since the purpose of Auditor is to obtain information about the device

                        verified. You need a 2nd Android device running Auditor for local QR code
                        based verification. You can also use our optional device integrity
                        monitoring service for automatic scheduled verifications with support for

                        <p>Auditor is primarily based on a pairing model where it generates a
                        hardware backed signing key and hardware backed attestation signing key
                        and pins them as part of the initial verification. The first verification
                        is bootstrapped based on chaining trust to one of the Android attestation
                        roots. After the first verification, it provides a highly secure system
                        for obtaining information about the device going forward. An attacker
                        could bypass the initial verification with a leaked attestation key or by
                        proxying to another device with the device model, OS and patch level that
                        the user is expecting. Proxying to another device will be addressed in the

                    <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process
                    described above. However, before flashing and locking, there's an additional step
                    to fully revert the device to a clean factory state.</p>

                    <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
                    needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. Before flashing the
                    stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
                    Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
