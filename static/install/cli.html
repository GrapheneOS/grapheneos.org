            <h1><a href="#cli-install">CLI install guide</a></h1>

            <p>This is a guide on installing GrapheneOS on the
            <a href="/faq#supported-devices">officially supported devices</a>. It can be followed
            for both the <a href="/releases">official releases</a> and <a href="/build">custom
            builds</a>. The <a href="/install/web">web installer</a> is an
            easier approach to installing the official releases via a browser with WebUSB
            support.</p>

            <p>We strongly recommend following these official instructions. The official guide has
            a lot of collaborative effort put into covering all of the edge cases and is regularly
            tested by many people on each supported OS. Following these instructions to the letter
            without skipping, reordering or adding any steps will give you a proper GrapheneOS
            installation unless there's a hardware issue. We strongly recommend against following
            unofficial guides deviating in any way from the official instructions.</p>

            <p>If you have trouble with the installation process, ask for help on the
            <a href="/contact#community">official GrapheneOS chat channel</a>. There are almost
            always people around willing to help with it. Before asking for help, make an attempt
            to follow the guide on your own and then ask for help with anything you get stuck
            on.</p>

                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>Officially supported operating systems for the CLI install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                    <li>Windows 11</li>
                    <li>macOS Big Sur</li>
                    <li>macOS Monterey</li>
                    <li>Arch Linux</li>
                    <li>Debian 10 (buster)</li>
                    <li>Debian 11 (bullseye)</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 21.10</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>The <a href="/install/web">web installer</a> is more portable and can be used
                from Android, ChromeOS and GrapheneOS itself since it can run anywhere with a
                browser with working WebUSB support.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have
                the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the
                early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early
                in the installation process.</p>

                <h2><a href="#enabling-oem-unlocking">Enabling OEM unlocking</a></h2>

                <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

                <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and
                repeatedly pressing the build number menu entry until developer mode is
                enabled.</p>

                <p>Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer options and toggle on the
                'OEM unlocking' setting. This requires internet access on devices with Google
                Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection.</p>

            <section id="opening-terminal">
                <h2><a href="#opening-terminal">Opening terminal</a></h2>

                <p>These instructions use command-line tools. Launch the terminal as you would any
                other application. On Windows, launch a regular non-administrator instance of the
                PowerShell terminal. Do not use the legacy Command Prompt or administrator variant
                of PowerShell.</p>

                <p>Use the same terminal for the whole installation process. If you close it,
                you'll lose the setup of the environment for the installation.</p>

                <p>On Windows, run the following command to remove PowerShell's legacy curl alias
                for the current shell to avoid needing to reference it as <code>curl.exe</code>
                instead of <code>curl</code>:</p>

                <h2><a href="#obtaining-fastboot">Obtaining fastboot</a></h2>

                <p>You need an updated copy of the <code>fastboot</code> tool and the
                directory containing it needs to be included in the <code>PATH</code>
                environment variable. You can run <code>fastboot --version</code> to determine
                the current version. It must be at least <code>31.0.3</code>. You can use a
                distribution package for this, but most of them mistakenly package development
                snapshots of fastboot, clobber the standard version scheme for platform-tools
                (adb, fastboot, etc.) with their own scheme and don't keep it up-to-date
                despite that being crucial.</p>

                <p>On Arch Linux, install <code>android-tools</code> and skip the section below on
                using the standalone release of platform-tools from Android:</p>

                <pre>sudo pacman -S android-tools</pre>

                <p>Debian and Ubuntu do not have a usable package for fastboot. Their packages for
                these tools are both broken and many years out-of-date. Follow the instructions
                below for platforms without a proper package.</p>

                <section id="standalone-platform-tools">
                    <h3><a href="#standalone-platform-tools">Standalone platform-tools</a></h3>

                    <!-- https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools -->

                    <p>If your operating system doesn't include a usable version of fastboot,
                    you can use the official standalone releases of platform-tools. This is
                    our recommendation for most users. The flashing process won't work unless
                    you follow these instructions including setting up PATH.</p>

                    <p>Next, add the tools to your <code>PATH</code> in the current shell so they can be
                    used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script.</p>

                    <p>On Debian, Ubuntu and macOS:</p>

                    <pre>export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"</pre>

                    <p>This only changes <code>PATH</code> for the current shell and will need

                <p>On traditional Linux distributions, USB devices cannot be used as non-root

                you didn't have the udev rules set up when you connected it.</p>

                <p>On Windows, you need to install a driver for fastboot if you don't already have
                it. No driver is needed on other operating systems. You can obtain the driver from
                Windows Update which will detect it as an optional update when the device is
                booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the computer. Open Windows
                Update, run a check for updates and then open the "View optional updates"
                interface. Install the driver for the Android bootloader interface as an optional
                update.</p>

                <p>An alternative approach to obtaining the Windows fastboot driver is to obtain
                the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb">latest driver for

                <p>You can either download the files with your browser or using a command like

                <p>Download the factory images for the device from <a href="/releases">the releases

                    <p>A common issue on Linux distributions is that they mount the default temporary file
                    directory <code>/tmp</code> as tmpfs which results in it being backed by memory and
                    swap rather than persistent storage. By default, the size is 50% of the available
                    virtual memory. This is often not enough for the flashing process, especially since
                    <code>/tmp</code> is shared between applications and users. To use a different
                    temporary directory if your <code>/tmp</code> doesn't have enough space available:</p>

                <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
                prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
                detect modifications to any of the OS partitions and it will prevent reading any
                modified / corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used
                to attempt to obtain the original data at which point it's verified again which
                makes verified boot robust to non-malicious corruption.</p>

                <p>In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:</p>

                    <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
                    hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
                    are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
                    OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
                    images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
                    GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
                    Auditor mode.</p>

                    <p>The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and has
                    pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
                    However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification
                    via the attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting
                    the device to the network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which
                    stops being possible after the initial verification). Further protection
                    against proxying the initial pairing will be provided in the future via
                    optional support for ID attestation to include the serial number in the
                    hardware verified information to allow checking against the one on the box /
                    displayed in the bootloader. See the <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a>
                    for a guide.</p>

                    <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
                    again between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
                    cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
                    device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
                    also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>
