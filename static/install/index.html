            <h1><a href="#install">Install</a></h1>
            <p>GrapheneOS has two officially supported installation methods. You can either use the <a
                    href="/install/web">WebUSB-based installer</a> recommended for most users or the <a
                    href="/install/cli">command-line installation guide</a> aimed at more technical users.</p>
            <p>We strongly recommend using one of the official installation methods. Third party installation guides
                tend to be out-of-date and often contain misguided advice and errors.</p>
            <p>If you have trouble with the installation process, ask for help on the <a
                    href="/contact#community">official GrapheneOS chat channel</a>. There are almost always people
                around willing to help with it. Before asking for help, make an attempt to follow the guide on your own
                and then ask for help with anything you get stuck on.</p>
            <p>The command-line approach requires being on an OS with proper fastboot and OpenSSH packages, along with
                understanding the process enough to avoid blindly trusting the instructions from our site. The web-based
                installation approach avoids needing any software beyond a browser with WebUSB support and you can still
                avoid trusting our server infrastructure by checking the verified boot key hash.</p>
