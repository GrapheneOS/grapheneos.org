            <p>This is the WebUSB-based installer for GrapheneOS and is the recommended approach
            for most users. The <a href="/install/cli">command-line installation guide</a> is the
            more traditional approach to installing GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>If you have trouble with the installation process, ask for help on the
            <a href="/contact#community">official GrapheneOS chat channel</a>. There are almost
            always people around willing to help with it. Before asking for help, make an attempt
            to follow the guide on your own and then ask for help with anything you get stuck
            on.</p>

                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You need a computer for running the web installer with at least 2GB of free
                memory available and 32GB of free storage space. The web installer can be run on an
                Android phone or tablet, unlike the command-line installation.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to the computer performing the
                installation. Whenever possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C
                cable packaged with the device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports,
                you'll need a high quality USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub
                such as the front panel on a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port
                on a desktop or the ports on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs
                are broken and are the most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>Officially supported operating systems for the web install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                    <li>Windows 11</li>
                    <li>macOS Sonoma (14)</li>
                    <li>macOS Sequoia (15)</li>
                    <li>macOS Tahoe (26)</li>
                    <li>Arch Linux</li>
                    <li>Debian 12 (bookworm)</li>
                    <li>Debian 13 (trixie)</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 25.04</li>
                    <li>Linux Mint 21 (follow Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instructions)</li>
                    <li>Linux Mint 22 (follow Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instructions)</li>
                    <li>Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 (follow Debian 12 instructions)</li>
                    <li>ChromeOS</li>
                    <li>GrapheneOS</li>
                    <li>Android 13 with Play Protect certification</li>
                    <li>Android 14 with Play Protect certification</li>
                    <li>Android 15 with Play Protect certification</li>
                    <li>Android 16 with Play Protect certification</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Older end-of-life versions of these platforms can also be used but are not
                officially supported.</p>

                <p>Make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>Officially supported browsers for the web install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Chromium (outside Ubuntu, since they ship a broken Snap package without working WebUSB)</li>
                    <li>Vanadium (GrapheneOS)</li>
                    <li>Google Chrome</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
                    <li>Brave (with Brave Shields disabled, since it caps storage usage at a low value to avoid fingerprinting available storage)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>On Android, disable desktop mode for the browser since it currently prevents our
                web installer from detecting Android and handling needing to request permission to
                reconnect to the device after each reboot. Desktop mode is enabled by default on
                large tablets with at least 8GB of RAM such as the Pixel Tablet.</p>

                <p>You should avoid Flatpak and Snap versions of browsers, as they're known to cause issues during the installation process.</p>

                <p>Make sure your browser is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>Do not use Incognito or other private browsing modes. These modes usually
                prevent the web installer from having enough storage space to extract the
                downloaded release.</p>

                <p>You need one of the <a href="/faq#supported-devices">officially supported
                devices</a>. To make sure that the device can be unlocked to install GrapheneOS,
                avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier variants of Pixels use the same stock
                OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id flashed onto the persist partition in the
                factory. The carrier id activates carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS
                including disabling carrier and bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to
                remotely disable this, but their support staff may not be aware and they probably
                won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic device to avoid the risk and potential hassle.
                If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a carrier device, it isn't a problem as
                GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have
                the latest firmware for connecting the device to the computer and performing the
                early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early
                in the installation process.</p>

            <section id="enabling-oem-unlocking">
                <h2><a href="#enabling-oem-unlocking">Enabling OEM unlocking</a></h2>

                <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

                <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to <b>Settings&#160;> About phone/tablet</b> and repeatedly
                pressing the <b>Build number</b> menu entry until developer mode is enabled.</p>

                <p>Next, go to <b>Settings&#160;>
                System&#160;> Developer options</b> and
                toggle on the <b>OEM unlocking</b> setting. On device model variants (SKUs) which
                support being sold as locked devices by carriers, enabling <b>OEM unlocking</b>
                requires internet access so that the stock OS can check if the device was sold as
                locked by a carrier.</p>

                <p>For the Pixel 6a, OEM unlocking won't work with the version of the stock OS
                from the factory. You need to update it to the June 2022 release or later via an
                over-the-air update. After you've updated it you'll also need to factory reset
                the device to fix OEM unlocking.</p>

                <p>On traditional Linux distributions, USB devices cannot be used as non-root
                without udev rules for each type of device. This is not an issue for other
                platforms.</p>

                <p>On Arch Linux:</p>

                <pre>sudo pacman -S android-udev</pre>

                <h2><a href="#working-around-fwupd-bug-on-linux-distributions">Working around fwupd bugs on Linux distributions</a></h2>

                <p>The fwupd software often used on Linux distributions for updating firmware is
                known to incorrectly connect to arbitrary devices using the fastboot protocol which
                will block using them for the intended purpose. This can result in receiving an
                error about the USB device already being in use (claimed) when trying to connect to
                it for the intended purpose.</p>

                <p>You can stop fwupd with the following command:</p>

                <pre>sudo systemctl stop fwupd.service</pre>

                <p>This doesn't disable the service and it will start again on reboot.</p>

            <section id="booting-into-the-bootloader-interface">
                <h2><a href="#booting-into-the-bootloader-interface">Booting into the bootloader interface</a></h2>

                <p>You need to boot your device into the bootloader interface. To do this, you need
                to hold the volume down button while the device boots.</p>

                <p>The easiest approach is to reboot the device and begin holding the volume down
                button until it boots up into the bootloader interface.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, turn off the device, then boot it up while holding the volume
                down button during the boot process. You can either boot it with the power button
                or by plugging it in as required in the next section.</p>

                <p>This step is not complete until your device displays a red warning triangle
                and the words "Fastboot Mode".  You must not press the device's power button
                to activate the "Start" menu item, because the device must remain paused in
                Fastboot mode for the installer to connect to it.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="connecting-device">
                <h2><a href="#connecting-device">Connecting the device</a></h2>

                <p>Connect the device to the computer. On Linux, you'll need to do this again if
                you didn't have the udev rules set up when you connected it.</p>

                <p>Current Windows 10 and Windows 11 include a generic driver usable for fastboot
                and no longer require installing a driver for installation on the Pixel 4a (5G) or
                later. It isn't enough for legacy 4th generation Pixels due to the driver not
                handling fastbootd, so you still need the driver for those. Outdated Windows
                versions will still need the driver for non-obsolete devices too. You can obtain the
                driver from Windows Update which will detect it as an optional update when the
                device is booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the computer. Open
                Windows Update, run a check for updates and then open the "View optional updates"
                interface. Install the driver for the Android bootloader interface as an optional
                update, which will show up as "LeMobile Android Device" due to USB ID overlap. An
                alternative approach to obtaining the Windows fastboot driver is to obtain the <a
                href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb">latest driver for
                Pixels</a> from Google and then <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#InstallingDriver">manually
                install it with the Windows Device Manager</a>.</p>

                <p>For the Pixel Tablet, disconnect it from the stand before continuing. The stand
                uses USB to provide charging and audio output, but the tablet lacks support for
                using both the stand and USB port at the same time.</p>

                <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
                prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
                detect modifications to any of the OS partitions and it will prevent reading any
                modified or corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used
                to attempt to obtain the original data at which point it's verified again which
                makes verified boot robust to non-malicious corruption.</p>

                <p>In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:</p>

                <button id="lock-bootloader-button" disabled="">Lock bootloader</button>

                <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data. Use one
                of the volume buttons to switch the selection to accepting it and the power button
                to confirm.</p>

                    <p>The verified boot and attestation features provided by the supported
                    devices can be used to verify that the hardware, firmware and GrapheneOS
                    installation are genuine. Even if the computer you used to flash GrapheneOS
                    was compromised and an attacker replaced GrapheneOS with their own malicious
                    OS, it can be detected with these features.</p>

                    <p>Verified boot verifies the entirety of the firmware and OS images on every
                    boot. The public key for the firmware images is burned into fuses in the SoC at
                    the factory. Firmware security updates also update the rollback index burned
                    into fuses to provide rollback protection.</p>

                    <p>The final firmware boot stage before the OS is responsible for verifying
                    it. For the stock OS, it uses a hard-wired public key. Installing GrapheneOS
                    flashes the GrapheneOS verified boot public key to the secure element. Each
                    boot, this key is loaded and used to verify the OS. For both the stock OS and
                    GrapheneOS, a rollback index based on the security patch level is loaded from
                    the secure element to provide rollback protection.</p>

                        <p>GrapheneOS provides our Auditor app for using a combination of the
                        verified boot and attestation features to verify that the hardware,
                        firmware and operating system are genuine along with providing other
                        useful data from the hardware and operating system.</p>

                        <p>Since the purpose of Auditor is to obtain information about the device
                        without trusting it to be honest, results aren't shown on the device being
                        verified. You need a 2nd Android device running Auditor for local QR code
                        based verification. You can also use our optional device integrity
                        monitoring service for automatic scheduled verifications with support for
                        email alerts.</p>

                        <p>See the <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a>
                        for a guide.</p>

                        <p>Auditor is primarily based on a pairing model where it generates a
                        hardware backed signing key and hardware backed attestation signing key
                        and pins them as part of the initial verification. The first verification
                        is bootstrapped based on chaining trust to one of the Android attestation
                        roots. After the first verification, it provides a highly secure system
                        for obtaining information about the device going forward. An attacker
                        could bypass the initial verification with a leaked attestation key or by
                        proxying to another device with the device model, OS and patch level that
                        the user is expecting. Proxying to another device will be addressed in the
                        future with optional support for the hardware serial number attestation
                        feature.</p>

                    <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is similar to the
                    process described above but with

                    fully revert the device to a clean factory state.</p>

                    <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
                    needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. Before flashing the
                    stock factory images, you should boot the device into fastboot mode and make sure the
                    bootloader is unlocked. Then erase the custom Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
