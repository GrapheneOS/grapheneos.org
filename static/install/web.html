            <p>This is the WebUSB-based installer for GrapheneOS and is the recommended approach
            for most users. The <a href="/install/cli">command-line installation guide</a> is the
            more traditional approach to installing GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>If you have trouble with the installation process, ask for help on the
            <a href="/contact#community">official GrapheneOS chat channel</a>. There are almost
            always people around willing to help with it. Before asking for help, make an attempt
            to follow the guide on your own and then ask for help with anything you get stuck
            on.</p>

                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 32GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>Officially supported operating systems for the web install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                    <li>Windows 11</li>
                    <li>macOS Big Sur (11)</li>
                    <li>macOS Monterey (12)</li>
                    <li>macOS Ventura (13)</li>
                    <li>Arch Linux</li>
                    <li>Debian 10 (buster)</li>
                    <li>Debian 11 (bullseye)</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 22.10</li>
                    <li>ChromeOS</li>
                    <li>GrapheneOS</li>
                    <li>Google Android (stock Pixel OS) and other certified Android variants</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>Officially supported browsers for the web install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Chromium (outside Ubuntu, since they ship a broken Snap package without working WebUSB)</li>
                    <li>Vanadium (GrapheneOS)</li>
                    <li>Google Chrome</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
                    <li>Brave</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You should avoid Flatpak and Snap versions of browsers, as they're known to cause issues during the installation process.</p>

                <p>Make sure your browser is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>Do not use Incognito or other private browsing modes. These modes usually
                prevent the web installer from having enough storage space to extract the
                downloaded release.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have
                the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the
                early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early
                in the installation process.</p>

            <section id="enabling-oem-unlocking">
                <h2><a href="#enabling-oem-unlocking">Enabling OEM unlocking</a></h2>

                <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

                <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and
                repeatedly pressing the build number menu entry until developer mode is
                enabled.</p>

                <p>Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Developer options and toggle on the 'OEM
                unlocking' setting. On device model variants (SKUs) which support being sold as
                locked devices by carriers, enabling 'OEM unlocking' requires internet access so
                that the stock OS can check if the device was sold as locked by a carrier.</p>

                <p>For the Pixel 6a, OEM unlocking won't work with the version of the stock OS
                from the factory. You need to update it to the June 2022 release or later via an
                over-the-air update. After you've updated it you'll also need to factory reset
                the device to fix OEM unlocking.</p>

                <p>On traditional Linux distributions, USB devices cannot be used as non-root
                without udev rules for each type of device. This is not an issue for other
                platforms.</p>

                <p>On Arch Linux, install the <code>android-udev</code> package. On Debian and
                Ubuntu, install the <code>android-sdk-platform-tools-common</code> package.</p>

                <p>You need to boot your phone into the bootloader interface. To do this, you need
                to hold the volume down button while the phone boots.</p>

                <p>The easiest approach is to reboot the phone and begin holding the volume down
                button until it boots up into the bootloader interface.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, turn off the phone, then boot it up while holding the volume
                down button during the boot process. You can either boot it with the power button
                or by plugging it in as required in the next section.</p>

            <section id="connecting-phone">
                <h2><a href="#connecting-phone">Connecting the phone</a></h2>

                <p>Connect the phone to the computer. On Linux, you'll need to do this again if
                you didn't have the udev rules set up when you connected it.</p>

                <p>On Linux, GNOME has a bug causing compatibility issues with the installation
                process. It wrongly detects the phone in fastboot mode or fastbootd mode as being
                an MTP device and claims exclusive control over it. This will block the install
                process from proceeding. You can run the following command to work around it:</p>

                <pre>echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers_autoprobe</pre>

                <p>After installing, you can undo this by rebooting or by running the following
                command:</p>

                <pre>echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers_autoprobe</pre>

                <p>On Windows, you need to install a driver for fastboot if you don't already have
                it. No driver is needed on other operating systems. You can obtain the driver from
                Windows Update which will detect it as an optional update when the device is
                booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the computer. Open Windows
                Update, run a check for updates and then open the "View optional updates"
                interface. Install the driver for the Android bootloader interface as an optional
                update.</p>

                <p>An alternative approach to obtaining the Windows fastboot driver is to obtain
                the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb">latest driver for
                Pixels</a> from Google and then
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb#InstallingDriver">manually

                <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
                prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
                detect modifications to any of the OS partitions and it will prevent reading any
                modified / corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used
                to attempt to obtain the original data at which point it's verified again which

                    <p>The verified boot and attestation features provided by the supported
                    devices can be used to verify that the hardware, firmware and GrapheneOS
                    installation are genuine. Even if the computer you used to flash GrapheneOS
                    was compromised and an attacker replaced GrapheneOS with their own malicious
                    OS, it can be detected with these features.</p>

                    <p>Verified boot verifies the entirety of the firmware and OS images on every
                    boot. The public key for the firmware images is burned into fuses in the SoC
                    at the factory. Firmware security updates can also update the rollback index
                    burned into fuses to provide rollback protection.</p>

                    <p>The final firmware boot stage before the OS is responsible for verifying
                    it. For the stock OS, it uses a hard-wired public key. Installing GrapheneOS
                    flashes the GrapheneOS verified boot public key to the secure element. Each
                    boot, this key is loaded and used to verify the OS. For both the stock OS and
                    GrapheneOS, a rollback index based on the security patch level is loaded from
                    the secure element to provide rollback protection.</p>

                        <p>When loading an alternate OS, the device shows a yellow notice on boot

                        show the full hash and you can compare it against the official GrapheneOS

                        <p>Checking this is useful after installation, but you don't need to check
                        it manually for verified boot to work. The verified boot public key
                        flashed to the secure element can only be changed when the device is
                        unlocked. Unlocking the device performs the same wiping of the secure
                        element as a factory reset and prevents data from being recovered even if
                        the SSD was cloned and your passphrase(s) are obtained because the
                        encryption keys can no longer be derived anymore. The verified boot key is
                        also one of the inputs for deriving the encryption keys in addition to the
                        user's lock method(s) and random token(s) on the secure element.</p>

                        <p>GrapheneOS provides our Auditor app for using a combination of the
                        verified boot and attestation features to verify that the hardware,
                        firmware and operating system are genuine along with providing other
                        useful data from the hardware and operating system.</p>

                        <p>Since the purpose of Auditor is to obtain information about the device
                        without trusting it to be honest, results aren't shown on the device being
                        verified. You need a 2nd Android device running Auditor for local QR code
                        based verification. You can also use our optional device integrity
                        monitoring service for automatic scheduled verifications with support for
                        email alerts.</p>

                        <p>See the <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a>
                        for a guide.</p>

                        <p>Auditor is primarily based on a pairing model where it generates a
                        hardware backed signing key and hardware backed attestation signing key
                        and pins them as part of the initial verification. The first verification
                        is bootstrapped based on chaining trust to one of the Android attestation
                        roots. After the first verification, it provides a highly secure system
                        for obtaining information about the device going forward. An attacker
                        could bypass the initial verification with a leaked attestation key or by
                        proxying to another device with the device model, OS and patch level that
                        the user is expecting. Proxying to another device will be addressed in the
                        future with optional support for the hardware serial number attestation
                        feature.</p>

                    <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is similar to the
                    process described above but with

                    fully revert the device to a clean factory state.</p>

                    <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
                    needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. Before flashing the
                    stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
                    Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
