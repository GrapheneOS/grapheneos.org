            <p>This is a WebUSB-based installer for GrapheneOS. The
            <a href="/install/cli">command-line installation guide</a> is the more traditional
            approach to installing GrapheneOS.</p>

            <section id="prerequisites">
                <h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the
                officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS. You should make sure
                your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding with these instructions. Older
                versions and other Linux distributions usually work, but if you encounter problems try
                using one of the officially supported options.</p>

                <p>For this web-based installation process, the latest stable release of Chromium,
                Chrome or Microsoft Edge is recommended. Other Chromium-based browsers will likely
                work but these are the ones that we test.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running
                the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running
                into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. You can
                either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for
                Pixel phones can be obtained from the
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">full update package page</a>.</p>

                <p>OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.</p>

                <p>Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and
                pressing on the build number menu entry until developer mode is enabled.</p>

                <p>Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer options and toggle on the
                'Enable OEM unlocking' setting. This requires internet access on devices with Google
                Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection.</p>

                <p>On Arch Linux, install the <code>android-udev</code> package. On Debian and
                Ubuntu, install the <code>android-sdk-platform-tools-common</code> package.</p>

                <p>On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot. You can obtain this

                <p>You need to obtain the GrapheneOS factory images for your device to proceed with
                the installation process.</p>

                <p>Press the button below to start the download:</p>

                <p>The initial install will be performed by flashing the factory images. This will

                OS, rebooting into the userspace fastboot mode, flashing the rest of the OS and
                finally rebooting back into the bootloader interface. Avoid interacting with the

                <h2><a href="#locking-the-bootloader">Locking the bootloader</a></h2>

                <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
                prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
                detect modifications to any of the OS partitions and it will prevent reading any
                modified / corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used
                to attempt to obtain the original data at which point it's verified again which
                makes verified boot robust to non-malicious corruption.</p>

                <p>In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:</p>

                <button id="lock-bootloader-button" disabled="disabled">Lock bootloader</button>

                <p>The command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data. Use one

                    <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
                    hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
                    are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
                    OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
                    images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
                    GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
                    Auditor mode.</p>

                    <p>The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and has
                    pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
                    However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification
                    via the attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting
                    the device to the network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which
                    stops being possible after the initial verification). Further protection
                    against proxying the initial pairing will be provided in the future via
                    optional support for ID attestation to include the serial number in the
                    hardware verified information to allow checking against the one on the box /
                    displayed in the bootloader. See the <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a>
                    for a guide.</p>

                    <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
                    against between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
                    cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
                    device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
                    also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>
