            <p>This is the WebUSB-based installer for GrapheneOS and is the recommended approach
            for most users. The <a href="/install/cli">command-line installation guide</a> is the
            more traditional approach to installing GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>If you have trouble with the installation process, ask for help on the
            <a href="/contact#community">official GrapheneOS chat channel</a>. There are almost
            always people around willing to help with it. Before asking for help, make an attempt
            to follow the guide on your own and then ask for help with anything you get stuck
            on.</p>

                <p>You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage
                space.</p>

                <p>You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever
                possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the
                device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality
                USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on
                a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports
                on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the
                most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough
                is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on
                bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited
                memory and storage space.</p>

                <p>Officially supported operating systems for the web install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                    <li>macOS Big Sur</li>
                    <li>Arch Linux</li>
                    <li>Debian 10 (buster)</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu 20.10</li>
                    <li>ChromeOS</li>
                    <li>GrapheneOS</li>
                    <li>Google Android on GrapheneOS-supported devices</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>Officially supported browsers for the web install method:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Chromium (outside Ubuntu, since they ship a broken Snap package without working WebUSB)</li>
                    <li>Bromite</li>
                    <li>Vanadium (GrapheneOS)</li>
                    <li>Google Chrome</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Make sure your browser is up-to-date before proceeding.</p>

                <p>Do not use Incognito or other private browsing modes. These modes usually
                prevent the web installer from having enough storage space to extract the
                downloaded release.</p>

                <p>You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can
                be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier
                variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id
                flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates
                carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
                bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their
                support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic
                device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a
                carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id
                and the hardware is the same.</p>

                <p>It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have
                the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the
                early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early
                in the installation process.</p>

                <p>On Arch Linux, install the <code>android-udev</code> package. On Debian and

                to hold the volume down button while the phone boots.</p>

                <p>The easiest approach is to reboot the phone and begin holding the volume down

                <p>Alternatively, turn off the phone, then boot it up while holding the volume
                down button during the boot process. You can either boot it with the power button
                or by plugging it in as required in the next section.</p>

                <p>Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also
                prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions.  Verified boot will
                detect modifications to any of the OS partitions and it will prevent reading any
                modified / corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used
                to attempt to obtain the original data at which point it's verified again which
                makes verified boot robust to non-malicious corruption.</p>

                    <p>Verified boot authenticates and validates the firmware images and OS from the
                    hardware root of trust. Since GrapheneOS supports full verified boot, the OS images
                    are entirely verified. However, it's possible that the computer you used to flash the
                    OS was compromised, leading to flashing a malicious verified boot public key and
                    images. To detect this kind of attack, you can use the Auditor app included in
                    GrapheneOS in the Auditee mode and verify it with another Android device in the
                    Auditor mode.</p>

                    <p>The Auditor app works best once it's already paired with a device and has
                    pinned a persistent hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain.
                    However, it can still provide a bit of security for the initial verification
                    via the attestation root. Ideally, you should also do this before connecting
                    the device to the network, so an attacker can't proxy to another device (which
                    stops being possible after the initial verification). Further protection
                    against proxying the initial pairing will be provided in the future via
                    optional support for ID attestation to include the serial number in the
                    hardware verified information to allow checking against the one on the box /
                    displayed in the bootloader. See the <a href="https://attestation.app/tutorial">Auditor tutorial</a>
                    for a guide.</p>

                    <p>After the initial verification, which results in pairing, performing verification
                    against between the same Auditor and Auditee (as long as the app data hasn't been
                    cleared) will provide strong validation of the identity and integrity of the
                    device. That makes it best to get the pairing done right after installation. You can
                    also consider setting up the optional remote attestation service.</p>

                    <p>Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is similar to the
                    process described above but with Google's web flashing tool. However, before
                    locking, there's an additional step to fully revert the device to a clean
                    factory state.</p>

                    <p>The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which
                    needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. After flashing the
                    stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom
                    Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:</p>
