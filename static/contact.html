                    <p>GrapheneOS has a very active community primarily based around the official
                    chat rooms. Our chat rooms are bridged across Discord, Telegram and Matrix so
                    you can choose your preferred platform.</p>

                    <p>Discord invite link: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/grapheneos">https://discord.com/invite/grapheneos</a>.</p>

                    <p>Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/GrapheneOS">https://t.me/GrapheneOS</a>.</p>

                    <p>You can join the GrapheneOS Matrix space at
                    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23community:grapheneos.org">#community:grapheneos.org</a>
                    and can manually join each of the chat rooms from there.</p>

                    <p>The following 7 chat rooms are available across each platform, with the
                    Matrix links to each individual room included below:</p>

                    <p>Matrix is a federated service similar to email where you can choose your
                    provider and has end-to-end encryption for private chats. Matrix can be a more
                    privacy friendly option but has significant downsides including lag, weak
                    moderation tools and the rooms needing to be regularly recreated due to bugs
                    in the protocol for reaching consensus on room state between servers.</p>

                    <p>The experience on Discord is the best out of all the available options
                    due to the way messages from the other platforms bridge to it, making
                    it much easier to read. Search is also generally better on Discord,
                    making it easier to look up information and previous discussions on
                    specific topics. Additionally, Discord allows you to select your preferred
                    release channels and devices via the roles feature in order to be
                    notified when an app or OS release in the channel you are interested in.</p>

                    <p>Telegram is a good option to choose if you already have a Telegram account
                    and use it. There is one Telegram group, which separates the different rooms via
                    topics.</p>

                <p>Do not contact us with offers to sell us products or services.</p>

                <p>Please don't contact the GrapheneOS project or developers to request support /
                device support / features or to report bugs. Use the <a href="#community">community
                platforms</a> and <a href="#reporting-issues">issue trackers</a> listed below. The
                developers are active on the Matrix room but the broader community can usually
                answer most questions, and this allows the developers to focus their time and
                energy on the project.</p>

                <p>Email is the preferred way to contact the project. X direct messages are
                checked much less frequently. A public @reply in a tweet is not a good way to contact
                the project. It is not considered sending a message by X and is not queued up as
                a message to be read, only as a regular notification that is likely to be missed or
                forgotten.</p>

                <p>Please do not send multiple copies / versions of the same email to different
                addresses. Either send it to a single address or CC the other addresses. In general,
                it's the same people handling every email address, and they don't need to see multiple
                copies of the same email in their inbox.</p>

                <p>You can contact <a href="mailto:contact@grapheneos.org">contact@grapheneos.org</a>
                for topics related to GrapheneOS. Please don't send emails unrelated to GrapheneOS to
                this address.</p>

                <p>The <a href="mailto:security@grapheneos.org">security@grapheneos.org</a>
                address is for reporting high priority security issues related to GrapheneOS. Please
                don't send other kinds of emails to this address. It is not a way of increasing the
                priority of emails that are not security reports. Your emails will be treated as a
                much lower priority if you misuse this address.</p>

                <p>Most issues should be reported to the global OS issue tracker for GrapheneOS
                sub-projects. However, standalone projects and anything outside of the GrapheneOS
