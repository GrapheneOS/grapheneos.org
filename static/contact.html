                <p>GrapheneOS has a very active community primarily based around the official chat
                rooms on Matrix.</p>

                <p>The links below will take you to the Element web client, which uses matrix.org as
                the homeserver by default. However, you can use the client and homeserver of your
                choice to join our rooms.</p>

                <p>The official GrapheneOS space groups together all of the official rooms along
                with members of the community who join the space. Spaces are a new experimental
                Matrix feature and older clients will see it as an unusable chat room rather than as
                a community space. You can join the space at
                <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/%23community:grapheneos.org">#community:grapheneos.org</a></p>

                <p>We have an official <a href="https://discuss.grapheneos.org">forum</a> for
                longer form posts, which will be more publicly accessible and easier to search.
                We are currently using Flarum for our forum.</p>

                <p>We have an official <a
                href="https://twitter.com/i/communities/1530455827949273094">Twitter community</a>
                for GrapheneOS discussions. You currently need to be logged in to access the new
                Twitter community feature. Discussions about GrapheneOS and apps/services to use
                on GrapheneOS are welcome. Once you join the community, you can post a thread in
                the community as an alternative to posting to your own timeline. It will be shown
                to other members of the community rather than to your followers outside the
                community. It's essentially a discussion forum within Twitter.</p>

                <p>The official subreddit is
                <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS">/r/GrapheneOS</a>. The subreddit is
                currently primarily used for announcements and you should use the Matrix
                rooms to seek support or participate in the community.</p>

            <section id="contacting-the-project">
                <h2><a href="#contacting-the-project">Contacting the project</a></h2>

                <p>Do not contact us with offers to sell us products or services.</p>

                <p>Please don't contact the GrapheneOS project or developers to request support /
                device support / features or to report bugs. Use the <a href="#community">community
                platforms</a> and <a href="#reporting-issues">issue trackers</a> listed below. The
                developers are active on the Matrix room but the broader community can usually
                answer most questions, and this allows the developers to focus their time and
                energy on the project.</p>

                <p>Email is the preferred way to contact the project. Twitter direct messages are
                checked much less frequently. A public @reply in a tweet is not a good way to contact
                the project. It is not considered sending a message by Twitter and is not queued up as
                a message to be read, only as a regular notification that is likely to be missed or
                forgotten.</p>

                <p>Please do not send multiple copies / versions of the same email to different
                addresses. Either send it to a single address or CC the other addresses. In general,
                it's the same person handling every email address, and they don't need to see multiple
                copies of the same email in their inbox.</p>

                <p>You can contact <a href="mailto:contact@grapheneos.org">contact@grapheneos.org</a>
                for topics related to GrapheneOS. Please don't send emails unrelated to GrapheneOS to
                this address.</p>

                <p>The <a href="mailto:security@grapheneos.org">security@grapheneos.org</a>
                address is for reporting high priority security issues related to GrapheneOS. Please
                don't send other kinds of emails to this address. It is not a way of increasing the
                priority of emails that are not security reports. Your emails will be treated as a
                much lower priority if you misuse this address.</p>

                <p>The email address of the lead developer is
                <a href="mailto:daniel.micay@grapheneos.org">daniel.micay@grapheneos.org</a>.</p>

                <p>The official Twitter account for the project is <a href="https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS">@GrapheneOS</a>
                which is used for official announcements. The account of the lead developer is
                <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielMicay">@DanielMicay</a> and is primarily focused on
                the privacy and security research/engineering work on GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Most issues should be reported to the global OS issue tracker for GrapheneOS
