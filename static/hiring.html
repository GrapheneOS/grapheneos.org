                <p>Must be able to commit to spending 80 hours or more a month, but we are extremely flexible about how you want to structure your working times. There is, however, a significant workload porting GrapheneOS forward when each new Android version is released. Having the capacity to focus and/or increase work hours during these periods is a great advantage.</p>
