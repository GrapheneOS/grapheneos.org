            <p>This section provides some rudimentary answers to frequently asked questions about GrapheneOS.
            It is intended to only give some matter of brief, accessible, non-intimidating answers to a few 
            questions about GrapheneOS and the projects associated with it and where possible, provide links
            to where more exhaustive answers can be found.</p>

           	</h3>           	
            <p>Support for other devices is planned, but there are a few requirements for full support from 
            Graphene OS. Rather than aim to try to support many devices, GrapheneOS seeks to support only 
            the devices with the best security, and focus on specific devices to ensure that the most 
            attention can be paid to the quality of the code, review, and testing. In order to be considered
             for support for GrapheneOS, a candidate device must meet the following criteria:
            <ul>
                <li>Strong support for alternative operating systems. Devices that do not have good support 
                for alternative operating systems, or devices that treat alternative operating systems as an
                afterthought will not be considered.</li> 
                <li>Hardware and firmware security features which include: hardware-backed keystore, 
                verified boot and remote attestation. In the future, Strongbox Keymaster may become 
                required.</li> 
                <li>Open-source drivers.</li>
                <li>Firmware that may be audited.</li>
                <li>Strong commitment for ongoing support from the vendor. This means a commitment towards 
                driver and firmware updates for a reasonable amount of time in the future, and a track 
                record of being able to deliver.</li>
            </ul></p>
            
        	<p>A more detailed answer is in the documentation at the entry under

            </h3>
        	<p>Please see <a href="#will-you-support-my-device">the above</a>. OnePlus devices do not meet 
        	the minimum requirements for support on GrapheneOS, and cannot be supported until they do.</p>

                <a href="#will-you-sell">"Do you sell phones with GrapheneOS preloaded?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>No. GrapheneOS is not a business, but rather a research and engineering project. Your 
            easiest bet to get a phone with GrapheneOS is to purchase one of the officially supported 
            devices as a bootloader-unlocked phone and simply run the installer. For security, Auditor can
            be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the installation. A start-to-finish 
            installation guide, which includes precompiled binary images, installer scripts, and digital 
            certificates to verify the integrity and authenticity of the images is included with the 
            <a href="https://GrapheneOS.org/install">installation guide.</a> Compiling from source is not 
            required to run GrapheneOS. The installer script will automate the process of flashing the OS 
            onto the phone.</p>

                phone?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Devices purchased for running GrapheneOS should be <i>bootloader</i> unlocked. Devices that 
            are sold by Verizon are <i>bootloader</i> locked and cannot be unlocked to allow them to be 
            flashed. Err on the side of caution: prior to purchasing, ask the seller if the phone has been 
            <i>bootloader</i> unlocked for flashing.</p>
            
            <h3 id="is-it-ready">
                <a href="#is-it-ready">"Is it ready to be used as a daily driver OS? What do you mean 'not 
                production ready?'"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Resoundingly yes, Graphene OS is stable and feature-rich enough to be utilized as a daily 
            driver operating system with two considerations. The disclaimer about being not production 
            ready is due to the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>An app store (F-Droid, Yalp, Google Play) is not included by default. The choice to 
                avoid including one was to allow the user to choose not to have one at all if so desired. 
                The lack of an app store requires tha t the user either manually install and update their 
                apps, find a trustworthy source for apps, or install an app store by obtaining the ".apk" 
                from a trustworthy source, and installing it by tapping the ".apk" file. An app store may be
                included in future builds when one can be found or created that satisfies security and code
                quality requirements set by the project.</li>
                <li>Apps that are hardcoded to be dependent on some Google software framework may not run at
                all, as GrapheneOS does not include it for privacy reasons. Some apps that do utilize but are
                 not dependent on Google software framework may run normally, but experience minor bugs such
                 as not displaying notifications until their respective apps are opened due to Push 
                 Notifications depending on Google Play, or consuming slightly more battery than normal 
                 because they must run in the background constantly, instead of sleeping until Google Play 
                 delivers a push notifications to tell the app to wake up and retrieve messages.</li>
            </ul></p> 
            
            <h3 id="i-bought-a-pixel-back">
                <a href="#i-bought-a-pixel-back">I bought a Pixel 1 back when the project was called 
                AndroidHardening or was sold under a now discontinued corporate branding and would like to 
                run GrapheneOS. What does 'Legacy' support mean?"</a>
            </h3>
           
            <p>Because Pixel 1s lack some of the security features that set the Pixel 2 and 3 apart, such as
            the hardware-backed keystore, insider access protection, and remote attestation, they will not 
            have all the security features of the newer devices that do. As time goes on, it becomes 
            increasingly likely that the vendor will cease to provide firmware patches and updates for these
            devices. Because of this, the Pixel and Pixel XL would not normally not meet the criteria for 
            support from GrapheneOS, but have both been included because the project supported them in the 
            past, and will continue to support them as a migration strategy. They are marked as "Legacy" 
            for these two reasons. </p>
            
            <p>Former users of AndroidHardening or other former incarnations of the project may download 
            the software packages consisting of pre-compiled binary images with installer scripts at the 
            <a href="https://grapheneos.org/releases#marlin-stable">releases page</a> under <i>Marlin</i> 
            (for Pixel XL) or <i>Sailfish</i> (for Pixel) and follow the instructions to install it on 
            their existing devices. Nexus 5X and 6P phones are no longer supported. </p>

            <h3 id="differences-lineageos-grapheneos">
                <a href="#differences-lineageos-grapheneos">"What is the difference between LineageOS and 
                GrapheneOS? Why would I choose GrapheneOS over LineageOS?"</a>
            </h3>           
            <p><i>"GrapheneOS is a privacy and security research and engineering project above all."</i> 
            With GrapheneOS, security hardening and privacy come first and all available development time 
            goes toward improvements in those areas while supporting only devices carefully chosen for 
            their security and features such as Verified Boot and Remote Attestation. In the future, the 
            operating system and user experience may be further locked down as a safeguard against malware,
            user error, and social engineering. </p>

            <p>LineageOS focuses heavily on permissiveness to allow the user to tinker, and widespread 
            device support, including many older devices, for which firmware and driver updates are no 
            longer available or no longer maintained. LineageOS also does not support Android Verified Boot,
            which is seen as desirable to allow users (or anyone else who has access to the phone) to make 
            changes as they please. As the goals of a strongly restricted and secure environment and very 
            careful device selection to select only the devices which have the best security, versus 
            permissiveness for user customizeability and widespread compatibility are mutually exclusive, 
            GrapheneOS should not be considered to be a competitor to LineageOS. The two are meant for 
            different purposes, and different audiences. </p>

            <p>More information on the project and its roadmap is available at the 
            <a href="https://grapheneos.org/#early-stage-of-development">writeup for development</a>.</a>

            <h3 id="what-about-librem">
                <a href="#what-about-librem">"What about Purism's Librem 5? How is GrapheneOS different from
                Librem 5/PureOS?"</a>
            </h3>
            
            <p>The Librem 5 builds on a proprietary ARM SoC and other proprietary components of which the 
            firmware source code is not open. In contrast to a modern smartphone operating system which runs
            the applications in their own contained environments, it utilizes the Linux software stack 
            running the GNOME desktop environment. The desktop software stack (in this case, consisting of a
            rebranded but otherwise copied-verbatim version of Debian) considers all the apps running in the
            same space to be trustworthy and offers no application isolation. The Librem 5 does not at this 
            moment appear to support verified boot, hardware-backed keystore and encryption and no technical
            information or source code has surfaced on IOMMU setup and mitigations. </p>
            
            <p>These design choices and vague promises of a "separate baseband" with the lack of any real 
            technical information on memory management suggest a haphazard and insecure design, and running 
            the desktop software stack represents many steps back for privacy and security. Daniel Micay has
            discussed this on the 
            <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/bd2fm7/grapheneos_an_open_source_privacy_and_security/ekxdp76/">/r/linux subreddit</a>.</p>
          
            <p>GrapheneOS on the other hand achieves its security via strong application isolation, improved
            memory management, IOMMU setup, SELinux security policies, and the project seeks to combine the 
            security features and hardening of the operating system with devices that support Verified Boot,
            remote attestation, and hardware-bound encryption. </p>
            
            <h3 id="will-you-support-librem">
                <a href="#will-you-support-librem">Will you support the Purism Librem 5?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>As per the question on support of devices, to reiterate, devices that will be considered 
            eligible for GrapheneOS support must have several important things: verified boot, hardware-
            backed keystore, hardware-bound encryption, full support for ARM SMMU or IOMMU, and ongoing 
            vendor support in the form of firmware and driver updates. The Purism Librem 5 has none of 
            these and cannot be supported.</p>

                operating system named after a type of American Pit Viper?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>No. The project predates that and traces its roots to an independent security/hardening 
            project that was started by Daniel Micay many years ago. At one point, phones that were pre-
            installed with Daniel's work were sold under a different branding that has since lapsed. 
            GrapheneOS is the original project that predates this branding and is being continued as a 
            research and engineering project. </p>

                <a href="#is-fork-of-lineage">Is or was GrapheneOS a fork of LineageOS or CyanogenMod?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>No, it is not a fork of LineageOS or CyanogenMod, and never has been. It is a research and 
            engineering project focused on improving the security and privacy qualities of the Android Open 
            Source Project and utilizing mobile devices that support the best security. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>It is the same difficulty as as flashing your phone back to the factory operating system. It 
            is much easier than installing LineageOS. Daniel Micay has included an automated installer 
            script that will do the heavy lifting for you, and a step-by-step walkthrough is available on 
            <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install">the project website.</a> You will need to be familiar
            with the commandline and be able to follow instructions to utilize Android Debug Bridge. 
            Remember to follow the instructions and lock your bootloader afterward! </p>

                data?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>By design, when your phone is unlocked to allow for flashing of the boot loader to install the 
            operating system onto it, as a safety precaution, your phone will immediately reset itself. This 
            will cause all data stored on the phone to be lost forever. This is done to prevent an attack where 
            someone may physically sieze and unlock the bootloader, install mallware or modify the operating 
            system to steal your password, then and present it to you as if nothing has happened. </p>
            
            <p>To prevent this, you can back up your files saved on your shared storage by connecting it to a 
            trustworthy USB storage device located in a physically secure and trustworthy environment such as 
            your private home to move your photos and shared storage to it, and back up your apps using Android 
            Debug Bridge, which includes a <code>backup</code> utility specifically for backing up your 
            application data, which you can restore in place later.</p>
            
            <p>Signal Private Messenger includes its own backup system which allows recovery of your verified

            </h3>
            <p>If an attacker has successfully exploited and gotten privileged (root) access on your device,
            Android Verified Boot (also called AVB) is designed to prevent a root-level compromise from 
            persisting and be able to revert the system to a known good state next reboot utilizing error 
            correction codes. This would require an attacker to compromise it a second time after a reboot,
            before they can continue to do nasty things to your phone. </p>
            
            <p>Remote Attestation adds more to this by utilizing some of the hardware security features in 
            modern phones to detect if unauthorized changes have occurred. In conjunction with each other, 
            these offer some means to guard against tampering with the operating system. </p>
            
            <p>A more detailed overview of verified boot is available at the official documentation about 
            <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot">Android Verified Boot</a>.

                project. What is it?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The hardened malloc is a memory allocator for the kernel which is designed to protect against
            memory corruption vulnerabilities. The one used in GrapheneOS is an all-new design developed by 
            Daniel Micay, although it is similar in design to OpenBSD's malloc. More detailed and technical 
            information on the purpose and design of the hardened memory allocator, as well as building it 
            and what it can do can be found at the manifest 
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md">at the Github page.</a></p>

                <a href="#cipher-on-disk">"What is the cipher used to encrypt data on the drive?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The file data is encrypted with AES-256 in XTS mode. Depending on the device, the filenames 
            are encrypted with AES-256-CTS, or AES-256-HEH. On the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, the Titan M is used to 
            verify the lock screen password as well as well as derive the symmetric keys to decrypt the 
            information stored on the solid state drives. Keys are of 256-bit length. The Advanced 
            Encryption Standard cipher is a thoroughly modern, well-tested cipher that has withstood 20 
            years of public cryptanalysis, and may be used with confidence. </p>
            
            <p>File-Based Encryption (FBE) has several advantages over Full-Disk Encryption (FDE). Access to
            the unlocked files can be granularized to allow certain profiles on the phones to be given 
            access to only what they need to access, without giving access to the entire drive and everything
             on it as would be the case with Full-Disk Encryption. This also allows the keys to be kept out 
             of memory when they are not in use and to limit the amount of access that profiles have to the 
             files. Layering of File-Based Encryption inside of Full Disk Encryption has been discussed by 
             Daniel Micay but has been determined not to be practical nor offer much appreciable security 
             benefit for the increased complexity and attack surface. </p>
            
            <h3 id="titan-m">
                <a href="#titan-m">"What is the Titan M? Why is it so important? How does GrapheneOS use it?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>The primary selling point of the Titan M hardware security module is the Strongbox Keymaster, 
            which allows secret keys to be created, stored and used within the chip, where even root on the 
            operating system cannot extract them. The physical separated chip offers significantly less 
            attack surface than ARM Trusted Execution Environment. Auditor on GrapheneOS starting with 
            version 11 of the Auditor App uses the Strongbox Keystore API for verifying the operating system 
            if it is present. This security feature has extensive functionality and could be used for secure 
            payments, public key cryptography, or allowing apps to use the Titan M to save data to the drive
            encrypted while the phone is locked, without a compromised operating system being able to steal 
            the keys. For example, one application that this would benefit from would be to allow the phone 
            to take pictures without needing to handle the keys to the drive. The chip is physically hard-
            wired to the buttons on the phone, so user input to it cannot be spoofed by a malicious app or a
            compromised operating system.</p>
            
            <p>It provides 'insider attack protection' which requires the owner to authenticate to the chip 
            using a password that is chosen by the owner, before the chip will allow the firmware of the 
            device to be updated. This is intended to dissuade a situation similar to the <i>2015 Apple v. 
            FBI</i> case, where a malicious actor could confiscate the device, find an exploit to gain 
            control of the operating system, then use legal or extralegal pressure to force Google to issue 
            a rogue firmware update that would disable the security features. Since the phone cannot accept 
            the updates without the owner's password, this removes the vendor from being a third party in 
            that particular attack vector.</p>
            
            <p>The Titan M is also used for verifying of the user's password and for drive encryption. The 
            chip creates and stores a secret token. The chip will not calculate and release the secret token 
            that the phone will use to derive the keys to the drive until it gets the correct password. 
            Since the chip uses its own internal timer built into it, it can enforce a progressively 
            lengthening timeout to deter brute force attacks more reliably than relying on the strength of 
            the password and a work factor such as a key derivation function alone. This also presents a 
            safer alternative to keeping the keys in a continually precarious state and erasing them should 
            ten incorrect guesses at the pincode be made. Unlike the factory image, GrapheneOS supports the 
            use of long passphrases to allow for both security measures of a cryptographically strong 
            passphrase and hardware bound encryption to be used together, combining hardware-backed 
            encryption with a cryptographically strong passphrase.  </p>
            
            <p>The Titan M is incorporated into the boot process by storing the last good version of the 
            operating system within itself and not allowing the phone to be downgraded to an earlier 
            revision to disable or roll back security protections. </p>
            
            <p>Factory Reset Protection to discourage steal-and-sell attacks is not yet implemented on 
            GrapheneOS, but is also one of the features it supports and may be implemented at a future 
            date.</p>

                Exploits?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS selects devices that allow for baseband isolation via IOMMU which is capable of 
            limiting direct memory access from the devices, and utilizes open source device drivers which 
            can be verified for their correctness. Additionally, the radios (cellular, Wi-Fi, Near Field 
            Contact, Bluetooth) are stateless. The operating system will load the binary firmware each time
            it boots, and the devices will validate the firmware. If they ever become compromised, rebooting
            the phone should reset them to the previous state, and verified boot should restore the operating 
            system to the state it was in when it was signed and the Android Verified Boot key was 
            provisioned.</p>
            
            <p>Secondly, should they ever turn evil, the IOMMU is designed to limit the access they have to 
            host memory, so the devices such as the phone's radios and modems, SSD, or graphics processor 
            cannot simply read or write to host memory at will unless the driver allows it to, and only to 
            locations the driver will allow. </p>

            <p>You don't.</p>
            
            <p>By design, Android assumes that the third-party apps running on it are untrustworthy and must
             be confined to their own self-contained environments. This allows the operating system to 
             enforce its own policy over them. These "security" apps such as Xprivacy and afwall are little 
             more than security theatre, or to work, require more privilege over other apps. This is mutually 
             exclusive with the goals of application isolation. </p>
            
            <p>Exposure of root access to an application or to allow one app to break out of its isolation 
            is defective by design, and is harmful to the security and privacy of your phone. GrapheneOS is 
            implementing its own networking controls that are handled via a privileged extension, which have 
            been committed but still need to be implemented at the UI level. </p>
            
            <h3 id="what-tweaking-needed">
                <a href="#what-tweaking-needed">"What security tuning or tweaking does GrapheneOS require 
                off the bat for security or privacy enhancements?"</h3>
            </h3>
            <p>None. GrapheneOS assumes a "secure by default" approach. The default search engine is Google 
            but may be set to Startpage or DuckDuckGo if you prefer.</p>
            
            <h3 id="do-you-provide-rooting">
                <a href="#do-you-provide-root">"Do you provide root?"</a>
            </h3>
            <p>No, root is not provided. Root is discouraged in a security-focused environment to minimize 
            access and privilege as much as possible. The defaults and policies have been very carefully 
            and very deliberately set by a developer and security researcher with many years of experience 
            and for specific reasons. Changing them will make your device less secure, not more.</p>
            
            <p>Granting root permission to any app will mean that the moment that app is exploited, the 
            entire operating system will be compromised, and the exploited app can read then the data out of 
            the other apps that it normally wouldn't be able to without root. Android already distrusts third-
            party apps, which represents a massive increase in the amount of security that the operating 
            system can provide when running programs that may not be trustworthy. </p>
            
            <p>Verified Boot will attempt to undo any of the changes that you make to the operating system 
            to roll it back to the last known good image that was signed and verified by the developers. 
            This means in order to have persistent changes made as root, you would need to disable Verified 
            Boot and leave your bootloader unlocked. Essentially, root access on GrapheneOS undoes most of 
            the hardening and security work that has gone into it and is at odds with the project goals.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS uses its own version, Vanadium. The included browser is used for webview and 
            adding other browsers will add an increase in attack surface. Vanadium will have more hardening 
            work done to it that will require integration with the operating system. Chromium was chosen as 
            a base for security reasons for its better sandboxing and architecture. </p>
            
            <p>A more detailed answer is available from Daniel Micay on the 
            <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bg03np/browsers/elhivgg/">project subreddit</a> 
            which discusses issues such as browser fingerprinting issues common to both Tor Browser and 
            Firefox, sandboxing, sidechannel attacks, and why Chromium was chosen to be the base for 
            Vanadium and as GrapheneOS' browser. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>There are a number of reasons that the auditor app could fail. <ul>
                <li>If the camera is shaking around too much or looking at the QR code from a skewed 
                perspective, it could cause the QR code to be read incorrectly. This will cause the auditor 
                app to fail. </li>
                <li>Bad lighting conditions or being too far away could cause the camera to pick up the QR 
                code incorrectly, which will also result in a failed audit. </li>
                <li>Holding either device at too much of an angle when scanning the QR codes may cause the 
                QR code to be read wrong and the audit to fail. </li>
                <li>The most common culprit for the attestation server to think a device has failed remote 
                attestation is time difference. If the time and date on your phone is not set correctly, 
                attestation will fail. </li>

            after the timer is up, or the operating system has been tampered with and the remote attestation 
            fails, the attestation server will send you an E-mail to warn you that the phone has for any

            <p>You should make sure that the E-mail account you receive your attestation notifications on is 
            not the same E-mail account accessible from your phone.</p>

            <p>This is also a known bug, as the camera app is borrowed from the Android Open Source Project

            </h3>
            <p>Sprint, Google Fi, Verizon and some mobile networks require proprietary drivers to be 
            installed in the operating system. These drivers occupy highly privileged positions in the 
            operating system and present a security (read: service provider backdoor) hazard. GrapheneOS 
            does not include them for this reason. These networks are not compatible with GrapheneOS. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>If your carrier does not require proprietary and privileged drivers to operate with their 
            network, GrapheneOS will work with it so long as your handset supports the frequency your 
            carrier uses. This is set by the baseband processor in your cellphone's software-defined 
            cellular radio, and is not set by the operating system.</p>

            <p>This is normal and expected behaviour, as the phone is now running a different operating 
            system than the factory one to the one installed on the phone by the manufacturer. If you see

            utilize the Auditor App for remote attestation to verify whether or not it worked. The Auditor 
            App utilizes the phone's hardware remote attestation features to detect compromise or 
            unauthorized changes to the OS and report them if they are detected. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>If you see this orange screen, the phone is telling you that the boot loader has been left 
            unlocked, which disables security measures such as Android Verified Boot. This allows persistent 
            changes to be written to the operating system at will. During the installation process of 
            GrapheneOS, unlocking the bootloader is a prerequisite to allowing the installer to run, but it 
            is crucially important that as soon as the installer has completed, the bootloader should be 
            locked again immediately. Your phone should never be used if your bootloader is unlocked; doing 
            so nullifies all the security benefits of having Verified Boot, and is very unsafe!</p>

            <p>Visit the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install#locking-the-bootloader">installation guide 
            on locking the bootloader</a> to find out how to fix this issue. Each time the bootloader is 
            locked or unlocked, as a safeguard the phone will be reset and all the data stored on the phone's 
            drive, such as photos, E-mails, text messages, saved passwords, and your Two-Factor 
            Authentication Tokens will be lost forever. If you have accidentally started using a phone with 
            an unlocked bootloader and saved data to it that you do not want to lose, you should save the 
            data by either utilizing the <code>adb backup</code> or <code>adb pull</code> utilities from 
            Android Debug Bridge to retrieve the files from the phone.</p>
