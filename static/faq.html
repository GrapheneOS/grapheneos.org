                <a href="#supported-devices">Which devices are supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS has official production support for the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3,
            Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. The release tags for these devices have official
            builds and updates available. These devices meet the stringent privacy and security
            standards and have substantial upstream and downstream hardening specific to the
            devices.</p>

            <p>Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be
            built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree. Device
            support repositories for the Android Open Source Project can simply be dropped into
            the source tree, with at most minor modifications within them to support GrapheneOS.
            In most cases, substantial work beyond that will be needed to bring the support up to
            the same standards. For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing
            a reasonably secure device, regardless of the work put into device support.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS also supports generic targets, but these aren't suitable for production
            usage and are only intended for development and testing use. For mobile devices, the
            generic targets simply run on top of the underlying device support code (firmware,
            kernel, device trees, vendor code) rather than shipping it and keeping it updated. It
            would be possible to ship generic system images with separate updates for the device
            support code. However, it would be drastically more complicated to maintain and
            support due to combinations of different versions and it would cause complications for
            the hardening done by GrapheneOS. The motivation doesn't exist for GrapheneOS, since
            full updates with deltas to minimize bandwidth can be shipped for every device and
            GrapheneOS is the only party involved in providing the updates. For the same reason,
            it has little use for the ability to provide out-of-band updates to system image
            components including all the apps and many other components.</p>

            <p>Some of the GrapheneOS sub-projects support other operating systems on a broader
            range of devices. Device support for Auditor and AttestationServer is documented in
            the <a href="https://attestation.app/about">overview of those projects</a>. The
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS">hardened_malloc</a> project supports nearly
            any Linux-based environment due to official support for musl, glibc and Bionic along
            with easily added support for other environments. It can easily run on non-Linux-based
            operating systems too, and supporting some like HardenedBSD is planned but depends on
            contributors from those communities.</p>

            <h3 id="recommended-devices">
                <a href="#recommended-devices">Which devices are recommended?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The recommended devices with the best hardware, firmware and software security
            along with the longest future support time are the Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 3 and
            Pixel 3 XL. The Pixel 3a and 3a XL are budget devices meeting the same security
            standards as the more expensive flagship devices. Compared to the Pixel 3a and 3a XL,
            the flagship Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have wireless charging, dual front-facing speakers,
            the Pixel Visual Core supporting HDR+ with compatible apps on GrapheneOS, IP68 dust
            and water protection, a higher-end screen, slightly more durable glass and of course a
            stronger CPU, GPU, cellular radio, etc. You should get one of the budget devices if
            these things aren't compelling to you. The Pixel 3a and 3a XL do have one extra
            feature: an analog headphone port as an alternative to wireless audio and digital
            USB-C audio.</p>

            <h3 id="future-devices">
                <a href="#future-devices">Which devices will be supported in the future?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Devices are carefully chosen based on their merits rather than the project aiming
            to have broad device support. Broad device support is counter to the aims of the
            project, and the project will eventually be engaging in hardware and firmware level
            improvements rather than only offering suggestions and bug reports upstream for those
            areas. Much of the work on the project involves changes that are specific to different
            devices, and officially supported devices are the ones targeted by most of this
            ongoing work.</p>

            <p>Devices need to be meeting the standards of the project in order to be considered as
            potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems,
            standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified
            boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available.
            Devices also need to have decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components such
            as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image
            processor, etc., because if the hardware / firmware support is missing or broken,
            there's not much that the OS can do to provide an alternative. Devices with support for
            alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be considered. Devices need
            to have proper ongoing support for their firmware and software specific to the hardware
            like drivers in order to provide proper full security updates too. Devices that are
            end-of-life and no longer receiving these updates will not be supported.</p>

            <p>In order to support a device, the appropriate resources also need to be available
            and dedicated towards it. Releases for each supported device need to be robust and
            stable, with all standard functionality working properly and testing for each of the
            releases.</p>

            <p>Hardware, firmware and software specific to devices like drivers play a huge role
            in the overall security of a device. The goal of the project is not to slightly
            improve some aspects of insecure devices and supporting a broad set of devices would
            be directly counter to the values of the project. A lot of the low-level work also
            ends up being fairly tied to the hardware.</p>

            <h3 id="when-devices">
                <a href="#when-devices">When will more devices be supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Broader device support can only happen after the community (companies,
            organizations and individuals) steps up to make substantial, ongoing contributions to
            making the existing device support sustainable. Once the existing device support is
            more sustainable, early research and development work for other devices can begin.
            Once a device is deemed to be a worthwhile target, the project needs maintainers to
            develop and maintain support for it including addressing device-specific issues that
            are uncovered, which will include issues uncovered in the device support code by
            GrapheneOS hardening features.</p>

            <p>It's not really a matter of time but rather a need for community support for the
            project increasing. As an open source project, the way to get something to happen in
            GrapheneOS is to contribute to it, and this is particularly true for device support
            since it's very self-contained and can be delegated to separate teams for each
            device. If you want to see more devices supported sooner, you should get to work on
            identifying good devices with full support for alternative operating systems with
            verified boot, etc. and then start working on integrating and testing support.</p>

            <p>It should also be clear that the expectation is for people to buy a device to run
            GrapheneOS, rather than GrapheneOS supporting their existing devices. This will only
            become more true if GrapheneOS is successful enough to accomplish the goal of having
            devices produced based on an SoC reference design with minor improvements for privacy
            and security. Broad device support is the opposite of what the project wants to
            achieve in the long term.</p>

            <h3 id="legacy-devices">
                <a href="#legacy-devices">Why are older devices no longer supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS aims to provide reasonably private and secure devices. It cannot do that
            once device support code like firmware, kernel and vendor code is no longer actively
            maintained. Even if the community was prepared to take over maintainance of the open
            source code and to replace the rest, firmware would present a major issue, and the
            community has never been active or interested enough in in device support to consider
            attempting this. Unlike many other platforms, GrapheneOS has a much higher minimum
            standard than simply having devices fully functional, as they also need to provide the
            expected level of security. It would start to become realistic to provide
            substantially longer device support once GrapheneOS controls the hardware and firmware
            via custom hardware manufactured for it. Until then, the lifetime of devices will
            remain based on manufacturer support. It's also important to keep in mind that phone
            vendors claiming to provide longer support often aren't actually doing it and some
            never even ship firmware updates when the hardware is still supported by the
            vendors...</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS also has high standards for the privacy and security properties of the
            hardware and firmware, and these standards are regularly advancing. The rapid pace of
            improvement has been slowing down, but each hardware generation still brings major
            improvements. Over time, the older hardware starts to become a substantial liability
            and holds back the project. It becomes complex to simply make statements about the
            security of the project when exceptions for old devices need to be listed out. The
            project ends up wanting to drop devices for this reason but has always kept them going
            until the end-of-life date to provide more time for people to migrate.</p>

            <h3 id="hardware-identifiers">
                <a href="#hardware-identifiers">Can apps access hardware identifiers?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>As of Android 10, apps cannot obtain permission to access non-resettable hardware
            identifiers such as the serial number, MAC addresses, IMEIs/MEIDs, SIM card serial
            numbers and subscriber IDs. Only privileged apps included in the base system with
            <code>READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE</code> whitelisted can access these hardware
            identifiers. Apps targeting Android 10 will receive a <code>SecurityException</code>
            and older apps will receive an empty value for compatibility.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS only makes a small change to remove a legacy form of access to the
            serial number by legacy apps, which was still around for compatibility.</p>

            <h3 id="default-connections">
                <a href="#default-connections">What kind of connections do the OS and bundled apps
                make by default?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS makes connections to the outside world to test connectivity, detect
            captive portals and download updates. No data varying per user / installation is sent
            in these connections. There aren't analytics / telemetry in GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>The expected default connections by GrapheneOS (including all base system apps) are
            the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The GrapheneOS Updater app fetches update metadata from
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-CHANNEL approximately once every four hours
                    when connected to a permitted network for updates.</p>
                    <p>Once an update is available, it tries to download
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-incremental-OLD_VERSION-NEW_VERSION.zip
                    for a delta update, and then falls back to
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-ota_update-NEW_VERSION.zip.</p>
                    <p>No query / data is sent to the server, so the only information leaked to it
                    are the variables in these 3 URLs (device, channel, current version) which is
                    necessary to obtain the update.</p>
                    <p>Users can control which types of connections the Updater app will use, and
                    although it's strongly recommended to always leave it enabled it can be
                    disabled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An HTTPS connection is made to https://time.grapheneos.org/ to update the
                    time from the date header field. This is a full replacement of Android's
                    standard network time update implementation, which uses the cellular network
                    when available with a fallback to SNTP when it's not available. This can be
                    disabled with the toggle at Settings ➔ System ➔ Date &amp; time ➔ Use
                    network-provided time. The time zone is still obtained directly via the time
                    zone provided by the mobile network when available.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>On devices with a Qualcomm baseband (which provides GPS), when location
                    functionality is being used,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals#Almanac">GPS almanacs</a>
                    are downloaded from https://xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin,
                    https://xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin or
                    https://xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin. GrapheneOS has modified all
                    references to these servers to use HTTPS rather than a mix of HTTP and HTTPS.
                    No query / data is sent to the server.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Connectivity checks designed to mimic a web browser user agent are performed
                    by using HTTP and HTTPS to fetch standard URLs generating an HTTP 204 status
                    code. This is used to detect when internet connectivity is lost on a network,
                    which triggers fallback to other available networks if possible. These checks
                    are designed to detect and handle captive portals which substitute the
                    expected empty 204 response with their own web page. These need use a very
                    common domain and URL in order to bypass whitelisting systems only permitting
                    access to common domains / URLs so a domain like grapheneos.org would likely
                    be inadequate. GrapheneOS leaves these set to the standard four URLs to blend

                <a href="#cellular-tracking">What does GrapheneOS do about cellular tracking and
                silent SMS?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS always considers the network to be hostile and does not implement weak
            or useless mitigations. Therefore, it does not have the assorted gimmicks seen elsewhere
            providing privacy/security theatre to make users feel better about these issues. One
            of the core tenets of GrapheneOS is being honest with users and avoiding scams/frills
            based around marketing rather than real world privacy/security threat models.</p>

            <p>Activating airplane mode will fully disable the cellular radio transmit and receive
            capabilities, which will prevent your phone from being reached from the cellular
            network and stop your carrier (and anyone impersonating them to you) from tracking the
            device via the cellular radio. The baseband implements other functionality such as
            Wi-Fi and GPS functionality, but each of these components is separately sandboxed on
            the baseband and independent of each other. Enabling airplane mode disables the
            cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular
            radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device.</p>

            <p>Even if interception of the connection or some other man-in-the-middle attack along
            the network is not currently occurring, the network is still untrustworthy and
            information should not be sent unencrypted. Legacy calls and texts should be avoided
            as they're not secure and trust the carrier / network along with having weak security
            against other parties. Trying to detect some forms of interception rather than dealing
            with the root of the problem (unencrypted communications / data transfer) would be
            foolish and doomed to failure.</p>

            <p>Receiving a silent SMS is not a good indicator of being targeted by your cell
            carrier, police or government because <em>anyone on the cell network can send
            them</em> including yourself. Cellular triangulation will happen regardless of whether
            or not SMS texts are being sent or received by the phone. Even if an SMS did serve a
            useful purpose for tracking, a silent SMS would be little different than receiving
            unsolicited spam. In fact, sending spam would be stealthier since it wouldn't trigger
            alerts for silent SMS but rather would be ignored with the rest of the spam. Regardless,
            sending texts or other data is not required or particularly useful to track devices
            connected to a network for an adversary with the appropriate access.</p>

            <h3 id="dns">
                <a href="#dns">How do I use a custom DNS server?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>It isn't possible to directly override the DNS servers provided by the network via
            DHCP. Instead, use the Private DNS feature in Settings ➔ Network &amp; internet ➔
            Advanced ➔ Private DNS to set the hostname of a DNS-over-TLS server. It needs to have
            a valid certificate such as a free certificate from Let's Encrypt. The OS will look up
            the Private DNS hostname via the network provided DNS servers and will then force all
            other DNS requests through the Private DNS server. Unlike an option to override the
            network-provided DNS servers, this prevents the network from monitoring or tampering
            with DNS requests/responses.</p>

            <p>Configuring a static IP address for a network requires entering DNS servers
            manually, but you should still use the Private DNS feature with it, and you shouldn't
            misuse the static IP address option just to override the DNS servers.</p>

            <p>VPN service apps can also provide their own DNS implementation and/or servers,
            including an alternate implementation of encrypted DNS. Private DNS takes precedence
            over VPN-provided DNS and using Private DNS is still recommended with a VPN.</p>

            <h3 id="private-dns-ip">
                <a href="#private-dns-ip">Why does Private DNS not accept IP addresses?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>By default, in the automatic mode, the Private DNS feature provides opportunistic
            encryption by using DNS-over-TLS when supported by the DNS server IP addresses
            provided by the network (DHCP) or the static IP configuration. Opportunistic
            encryption provides protection against a passive listener, not an active attacker,
            since they can force falling back to unencrypted DNS by blocking DNS-over-TLS. In the
            automatic mode, certificate validation is not enforced, as it would provide no
            additional security and would reduce the availability of opportunistic encryption.</p>

            <p>When Private DNS is explicitly enabled, it uses authenticated encryption without a
            fallback. The authentication is performed based on the hostname of the server, so it
            isn't possible to provide an IP address. The OS will look up the hostname of the Private
            DNS server via unencrypted DNS and then force all other DNS lookups via DNS-over-TLS
            with the identity of the server authenticated as part of providing authenticated
            encryption.</p>

            <h3 id="private-dns-other">
                <a href="#private-dns-other">Does DNS-over-TLS (Private DNS) protect other connections?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>No, it only provides privacy for DNS resolution. Even authenticating DNS results
            with DNSSEC does not protect other connections, unless the DNS records are part of the
            system used to provide authenticated encryption, and DNS-over-TLS is not a substitute
            for DNSSEC. If connections have authenticated encryption, they're secure even if DNS
            resolution is hijacked by an attacker. If connections do not have authenticated
            encryption, an attacker can listen in and tamper with them without hijacking DNS.
            There are other ways to perform a MITM attack than DNS hijacking and internet routing
            is fundamentally insecure. DNS-over-TLS may make a MITM harder for some attackers, but
            don't count on it at all.</p>

            <h3 id="private-dns-visited">
                <a href="#private-dns-visited">Does DNS-over-TLS (Private DNS) hide which sites are visited, etc.?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Private DNS only encrypts DNS, and an adversary monitoring connections can still
            see the IP address at the other end of those connections. Many domains resolve to
            ambiguous IP addresses, so encrypted DNS is part of what's required to take away a lot
            of the information leaked to adversaries. However, TLS currently leaks domains via
            SNI, so encrypted DNS is not yet accomplishing much. It's a forward looking feature
            that will become more useful in the future. Using it is recommended, but it's not an
            alternative to using Tor or a VPN.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS has built-in VPN support included in the operating system. Orbot, OpenVPN
            for Android, the userspace implementation of WireGuard, and the Private Internet Access
            VPN app have all been tested and reported working. VPNs can be configured under 
            Settings -> Network & Internet -> Advanced -> VPN.

            <p>There is an "Always-On VPN" toggle which forces connections to only use the
            configured VPN. This will prevent apps from falling back to an unsecured connection and
            leaking data outside the VPN in the event the connection to it is lost.</p>
