            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS is a privacy and security research and engineering project. 
                It's not a hobby project or volunteer work but rather full-time work. 
                The development team will be expanded with other full-time developers being paid to work on the project. 
                It will never be described as a custom ROM and it doesn't aim to please the ROM community.
                This just isn't the kind of project that is based on XDA, 
                and ultimately isn't going to be aimed at power users / tinkerers. 
                It's not going to be adding non-privacy / non-security related features to Android other than
                filling gaps left by not having Play Services, the Play Store and other Google apps.</p>
           
            <h3 id="los">
            	<a href="#los">2.How is GrapheneOS different from LineageOS or other AOSP forks?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS is an AOSP fork focused on AOSP hardening and security work. 
                It is not a competitor or alternative to LineageOS. It's a much different kind of project, 
                with drastically different priorities and a much different approach to software development, 
                testing and release engineering. GrapheneOS starts from AOSP without adding in the proprietary Google apps
                and services and focuses on privacy and security hardening to improve the OS from the baseline.
                It also preserves all the standard software and hardware security features,
                unlike other alternative operating systems.</p>
            
            <h3 id="funding">
            	<a href="#funding">3.What will be the business model for GrapheneOS? How will the project fund development?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS is a permissively licensed open source project and is a non-profit project. 
                It's not a business and there will be no business model. It will be funded by a wide range of companies
                and non-profit organizations with an interest in the continued development of the project.</p>

            <h3 id="stability">
            	<a href="#stability">4.Can I use GrapheneOS as my daily driver? Is GrapheneOS stable?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Yes. When it is said that the project is in early development, it means it's very barebones,
                lots of the past privacy/security features developed by the project are not yet ported to the current OS
                and it's only just getting started on accomplishing the goals. It's not unstable.
                The releases aren't nightly builds and each release is tested on each supported device.
                It doesn't come with many bundled apps. It still has some of the Android Open Source Project
                sample apps included that are not really meant to be used. It has a lot of gaps that still
                need to be filled from not having Google Play Services and Google apps.
                It isn't yet at the point where it's concerned with bundling a nice set of default apps,
                and you'll even need to install F-Droid on your own to have an app store. 
                Not much documentation has been written yet, so there's no detailed usage guide or tutorials.</p>

            <h3 id="device-support">
            	<a href="#device-support">5.Will device X be supported?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS will never be able to support a lot of devices. Most devices do not meet the security standards. 
                In order to be supported, devices need to make available the same security provided to the stock OS
                to alternative operating systems by not restricting important hardware security features to the stock OS.
                That includes making verified boot, attestation, full functionality of the hardware-backed keystore
                and any secure element features available. Pixels are among the devices where alternative operating systems
                can be installed and used securely. They also have the best security among the possible targets,
                but there are other viable targets with decent support for alternative operating systems.
                The targets also need to provide security updates and other maintenance for components not provided by AOSP.
                A device without monthly security updates isn't a candidate. 
                Devices nearing end of life also aren't going to be candidates for that reason, 
                and because it makes more sense to add current generation devices whether low end or high end
                since they support the current generation privacy and security features in hardware / firmware.
                Devices that are already supported will remain supported as long as they're receiving full security updates.</p>

            <h3 id="gapps">
            	<a href="#gapps">6.GApps?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>It's not going to be included in GrapheneOS for various reasons. 
                It's designed to be a set of privileged apps with many privileged permissions and deep integration in the OS.
                It also replaces AOSP components that are part of what GrapheneOS changes.
                It's not legal to include it, and properly including it rather than having a hacked together
                half working integration would be a fair but of work requiring lots of work on android-prepare-vendor.
                GrapheneOS intentionally doesn't conform to the CDD / CTS restrictions which would be required to license it.
                Making a variant with Google Play Services licensed would require conforming to those,
                even in the variant without Google Play Services, at least without challenging this legally.</p>

            <h3 id="microg">
            	<a href="#microg">7.microG?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>GrapheneOS won't be implementing alternative clients for Google services, 
                especially since they lack stable / documented APIs and it's not allowed to use them like this.
                It also brings most of the same issues as using them via Play Services. 
                I don't want a hacked together alternate implementation with worse robustness and security than the real thing.
                I highly recommend not applying the incredibly insecure microG signature spoofing patch.
                It destroys a substantial portion of the app security model by adding a permission any app can request
                to bypass any signature checks. Think about this in the context of an attacker gaining some control
                over the UI or in the verified boot security model... it's awful. Really, you're better off using
                the stock OS than doing something like this. If an attacker exploits microG, they should not be able to
                fake any app signature checks. It breaks part of the security model of the OS. 
                It needs to be restricted not only to exactly what requires it, but also to only faking the required signature.</p>

            <h3 id="future-gapps">
            	<a href="#future-gapps">8.Will there ever be a way Google apps and services will work on GrapheneOS?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>There will be a compatibility layer implemented but there's a lot to be done before getting to that at all.
                Android has various OS APIs that are implemented via apps providing the services. 
                This includes geocoding, supplementary location services, speech to text, text to speech, app verification,
                and a bunch of others. Alternate implementations of these need to be made in order to offer
                a fully functional Android environment. The Compatibility Test Suite allows not implementing these,
                since the Android Open Source Project does not, but many apps do not target minimal Android
                and break when only the minimum compatibility is available. It also means having missing features
                even when apps properly handle it, such as not having speech to text across different keyboards
                and apps and not having text to speech in apps providing navigation, etc.<br><br>

                There are also various things that can be provided by apps in the OS but not third party
                apps including screen recording, call recording, backups including app data rather than only
                shared data (which apps should not be using to nearly the extent that they do and which can already
                be backed up other ways), etc. Before even getting to the API extensions by Play Services, 
                there is a lot that can and should be done to provide a replacement of a lot of what it implements,
                which it a much higher priority.<br><br>

                It needs to be an approach focused on privacy and security. This starts from the ground up
                with how it provides the Play Services API extensions in a way that apps accept them. 
                I am certainly not going to take the approach of adding a permission which allows faking
                any signature permissions, which completely breaks a lot of the security model used by the OS
                including making verified boot largely useless. Doing it as a permission that any app can request
                is also a bad approach, and not just because users can be tricked into accepting it but also because
                it places a huge level of trust in persistent state and the application layer. 
                This is just the problems at the foundation of how it works though. It doesn't get into the problems
                with the implementation using this, which are comparable. I want a much different approach to things
                across the board, especially the supplementary location services.<br><br>

                I only even want full, real implementations of neutral APIs that are not specific to Google services.
                Many of these are implementations of AOSP APIs, while others are Play Services API extensions
                and require the OS to make the signature check pass for the Play Services signature, 
                and specifically for the alternate implementation of it. Some APIs use Google services under the hood
                but can be implemented without them, while others like GCM are fundamentally hard-wired to Google services
                and alternative implementations need to use a different API. The approach to those APIs that cannot have
                actual alternate implementations (only alternate clients using Google's services against the terms of service)
                needs to be creating stub implementations pretending the service is offline / cannot be reached.
                That's the best approach for GCM. It shuts up the warning / errors from apps and if they have
                an alternate implementation of push for when GCM is unavailable it will make them fall back to it.</p>
			
            <h3 id="disabled-vanadium-problem">
                <a href="#disabled-vanadium-problem">9.Why are apps crashing when I disable Vanadium?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>That's entirely expected, especially for the PDF Viewer that's quite explicitly designed around
                rendering PDFs inside a WebView. You didn't just disable the included browser app but also
                the WebView implementation that it provides. It's explained in the usage guide that Vanadium
                provides both the included user-facing browser app and the WebView implementation.<br><br>

                Before you can disable Vanadium in the Settings interface, it does explicitly warn you that
                you may be breaking other applications. It's a generic warning for system apps, and it's there for a reason.
                You also shouldn't disable the obsolete Search app at least without installing a
                compatible replacement because it provides a standard search API used by other applications.
                The plan is to replace these obsolete apps.</p>

            <p>Doing this would compromise the security of the whole OS and defeat the point of using GrapheneOS.
                None of the apps provide security enhancements, they are engaging in security theater
                and just provide more attack surface for exploitation while also degrading security overall.

                The picture quality matches the stock OS across apps, and the still picture quality from an app
                compatible with the Pixel Visual Core matches the stock OS. The Pixel 3a doesn't have the Pixel Visual Core,

                <a href="#android-app-compatibility">14.Are stock Android apps compatible with GrapheneOS?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>They are almost entirely compatible. GrapheneOS is tested with the Compatibility Test Suite
                which is a compatibility test suite primarily for the app API. If the app targets baseline Android,
                it will almost always work. Some apps may not be compatible due to privacy / security restrictions
                and mitigations, but this is rare, since the features are designed to be as compatible as possible.
                These cases are usually quite well understood and there are intentional failures when running
                the CTS that are documented with the reason for the failure. Some apps have latent issues
                like memory corruption bugs triggered in regular usage without an obvious impact, and some of the
                memory corruption mitigations can uncover these issues by aborting the app when it happens, etc.<br><br>

                Google Play Services isn't present, and many apps have soft or hard dependencies on it to varying extents.
                Some apps will be missing functionality, others will be inherently broken and others will simply
                refuse to work / crash because they didn't handle this case properly. You might be surprised by how
                many apps work though, including those from major corporations. For example, nearly all the Facebook
                and Microsoft apps will work fine.</p>
