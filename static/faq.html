            <p>This page contains answers to frequently asked questions about GrapheneOS. It's not
            an overview of the project or a list of interesting topics about GrapheneOS. Many of
            the answers would be nearly the same or identical for the latest release of the
            Android Open Source Project. The goal is to provide high quality answers to some of
            the most common questions about the project, so the developers and other community
            members can link to these and save lots of time while also providing higher quality
            answers.</p>

            <h2 id="device-support">
                <a href="#device-support">Device support</a>
            </h2>

            <h3 id="supported-devices">
                <a href="#supported-devices">Which devices are supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS has official production support for the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a,
            Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a. The release tags for these devices have
            official builds and updates available. These devices meet the stringent privacy and
            security standards and have substantial upstream and downstream hardening specific to
            the devices.</p>

            <p>The Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 aren't currently supported. The Pixel 4a 5G is poorly
            named and isn't really a variant of the Pixel 4a. It shares more in common with the
            Pixel 5 and our existing Pixel 4a support isn't relevant to it.</p>

            <p>Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be
            built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree. Device
            support repositories for the Android Open Source Project can simply be dropped into
            the source tree, with at most minor modifications within them to support GrapheneOS.
            In most cases, substantial work beyond that will be needed to bring the support up to
            the same standards. For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing
            a reasonably secure device, regardless of the work put into device support.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS also supports generic targets, but these aren't suitable for production
            usage and are only intended for development and testing use. For mobile devices, the
            generic targets simply run on top of the underlying device support code (firmware,
            kernel, device trees, vendor code) rather than shipping it and keeping it updated. It
            would be possible to ship generic system images with separate updates for the device
            support code. However, it would be drastically more complicated to maintain and
            support due to combinations of different versions and it would cause complications for
            the hardening done by GrapheneOS. The motivation doesn't exist for GrapheneOS, since
            full updates with deltas to minimize bandwidth can be shipped for every device and
            GrapheneOS is the only party involved in providing the updates. For the same reason,
            it has little use for the ability to provide out-of-band updates to system image
            components including all the apps and many other components.</p>

            <p>Some of the GrapheneOS sub-projects support other operating systems on a broader
            range of devices. Device support for Auditor and AttestationServer is documented in
            the <a href="https://attestation.app/about">overview of those projects</a>. The
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS">hardened_malloc</a> project supports nearly
            any Linux-based environment due to official support for musl, glibc and Bionic along
            with easily added support for other environments. It can easily run on non-Linux-based
            operating systems too, and supporting some like HardenedBSD is planned but depends on
            contributors from those communities.</p>

            <h3 id="recommended-devices">
                <a href="#recommended-devices">Which devices are recommended?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The recommended devices with the best hardware, firmware and software security
            along with the longest future support time are the Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL and Pixel
            4a.</p>

            <p>On the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, support for fingerprint unlock as a secondary unlock
            mechanism has been removed and replaced with IR-based 3D facial scanning. GrapheneOS
            plans to extend secondary unlock support with the option of 2-factor authentication
            using a secondary PIN or passphrase required for fingerprint / face unlock. The Pixel
            4a has a fingerprint scanner instead of the dual infrared face scanning cameras.</p>

            <p>The Pixel 4a is a budget device meeting the same security standards as the more
            expensive flagship devices. You can read more on the differences between the hardware
            elsewhere. Unlike the Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a has a proper SSD which provides a much
            better experience with the GrapheneOS exec-based spawning security feature.</p>

            <h3 id="future-devices">
                <a href="#future-devices">Which devices will be supported in the future?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Devices are carefully chosen based on their merits rather than the project aiming
            to have broad device support. Broad device support is counter to the aims of the
            project, and the project will eventually be engaging in hardware and firmware level
            improvements rather than only offering suggestions and bug reports upstream for those
            areas. Much of the work on the project involves changes that are specific to different
            devices, and officially supported devices are the ones targeted by most of this
            ongoing work.</p>

            <p>Devices need to be meeting the standards of the project in order to be considered as
            potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems,
            standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified
            boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available.
            Devices also need to have decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components such
            as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image
            processor, etc., because if the hardware / firmware support is missing or broken,
            there's not much that the OS can do to provide an alternative. Devices with support for
            alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be considered. Devices need
            to have proper ongoing support for their firmware and software specific to the hardware
            like drivers in order to provide proper full security updates too. Devices that are
            end-of-life and no longer receiving these updates will not be supported.</p>

            <p>In order to support a device, the appropriate resources also need to be available
            and dedicated towards it. Releases for each supported device need to be robust and
            stable, with all standard functionality working properly and testing for each of the
            releases.</p>

            <p>Hardware, firmware and software specific to devices like drivers play a huge role
            in the overall security of a device. The goal of the project is not to slightly
            improve some aspects of insecure devices and supporting a broad set of devices would
            be directly counter to the values of the project. A lot of the low-level work also
            ends up being fairly tied to the hardware.</p>

            <h3 id="when-devices">
                <a href="#when-devices">When will more devices be supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Broader device support can only happen after the community (companies,
            organizations and individuals) steps up to make substantial, ongoing contributions to
            making the existing device support sustainable. Once the existing device support is
            more sustainable, early research and development work for other devices can begin.
            Once a device is deemed to be a worthwhile target, the project needs maintainers to
            develop and maintain support for it including addressing device-specific issues that
            are uncovered, which will include issues uncovered in the device support code by
            GrapheneOS hardening features.</p>

            <p>It's not really a matter of time but rather a need for community support for the
            project increasing. As an open source project, the way to get something to happen in
            GrapheneOS is to contribute to it, and this is particularly true for device support
            since it's very self-contained and can be delegated to separate teams for each
            device. If you want to see more devices supported sooner, you should get to work on
            identifying good devices with full support for alternative operating systems with
            verified boot, etc. and then start working on integrating and testing support.</p>

            <p>It should also be clear that the expectation is for people to buy a device to run
            GrapheneOS, rather than GrapheneOS supporting their existing devices. This will only
            become more true if GrapheneOS is successful enough to accomplish the goal of having
            devices produced based on an SoC reference design with minor improvements for privacy
            and security. Broad device support is the opposite of what the project wants to
            achieve in the long term.</p>

            <h3 id="legacy-devices">
                <a href="#legacy-devices">Why are older devices no longer supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS aims to provide reasonably private and secure devices. It cannot do that
            once device support code like firmware, kernel and vendor code is no longer actively
            maintained. Even if the community was prepared to take over maintenance of the open
            source code and to replace the rest, firmware would present a major issue, and the
            community has never been active or interested enough in device support to consider
            attempting this. Unlike many other platforms, GrapheneOS has a much higher minimum
            standard than simply having devices fully functional, as they also need to provide the
            expected level of security. It would start to become realistic to provide
            substantially longer device support once GrapheneOS controls the hardware and firmware
            via custom hardware manufactured for it. Until then, the lifetime of devices will
            remain based on manufacturer support. It's also important to keep in mind that phone
            vendors claiming to provide longer support often aren't actually doing it and some
            never even ship firmware updates when the hardware is still supported by the
            vendors...</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS also has high standards for the privacy and security properties of the
            hardware and firmware, and these standards are regularly advancing. The rapid pace of
            improvement has been slowing down, but each hardware generation still brings major
            improvements. Over time, the older hardware starts to become a substantial liability
            and holds back the project. It becomes complex to simply make statements about the
            security of the project when exceptions for old devices need to be listed out. The
            project ends up wanting to drop devices for this reason but has always kept them going
            until the end-of-life date to provide more time for people to migrate.</p>

            <h3 id="clipboard">
                <a href="#clipboard">Can apps spy on the clipboard in the background or inject
                content into it?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>As of Android 10, only the configured default input method editor (your keyboard of
            choice) and the currently focused app can access the clipboard. Apps without focus
            cannot access the clipboard. This is a stricter restriction than preventing apps in
            the background from accessing it, since an app in the foreground or a foreground
            service cannot access it, only the foreground app that's currently focused. Clipboard
            managers need to be implemented by the keyboard chosen as the default by the user.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS previously restricted background clipboard access as a much earlier and
            slightly less strict implementation of this feature. It provided a toggle for users to
            whitelist clipboard managers, which is no longer needed now that keyboards are
            expected to provide it.</p>

            <h3 id="hardware-identifiers">
                <a href="#hardware-identifiers">Can apps access hardware identifiers?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>As of Android 10, apps cannot obtain permission to access non-resettable hardware
            identifiers such as the serial number, MAC addresses, IMEIs/MEIDs, SIM card serial
            numbers and subscriber IDs. Only privileged apps included in the base system with
            <code>READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE</code> whitelisted can access these hardware
            identifiers. Apps targeting Android 10 will receive a <code>SecurityException</code>
            and older apps will receive an empty value for compatibility.</p>

            <p>Since these restrictions became standard, GrapheneOS only makes a small change to
            remove a legacy form of access to the serial number by legacy apps, which was still
            around for compatibility. It used to need more extensive changes such as disallowing
            access to the serial number but those restrictions are now standard.</p>

            <p>Apps can determine the model of the device (such as it being a Pixel 4) either
            directly or indirectly through the properties of the hardware and software. There
            isn't a way to avoid this short of the OS supporting running apps in a virtual machine
            with limited functionality and hardware acceleration. Hiding the CPU/SoC model would
            require not even using basic hardware virtualization support and these things could
            probably still be detected via performance measurements.</p>

            <h3 id="non-hardware-identifiers">
                <a href="#non-hardware-identifiers">What about non-hardware identifiers?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>In addition to not having a way to identify the hardware, apps cannot directly
            identify the installation of the OS on the hardware. Apps only have a small portion of
            the OS configuration exposed to them and there is not much for device owners to change
            which could identify their installation. Apps can detect that they're being run on
            GrapheneOS via the privacy and security features placing further restrictions on them
            and hardening them against further exploitation. Apps can identify their own app
            installation via their app data and can directly (until that's removed) or indirectly
            identify a profile. Profiles should be used when separate identities are desired.
            Profiles can be used as temporary ephemeral identifies by creating them for a specific
            need and then deleting them. The rest of this answer only provides more technical
            details, so you can stop reading here if you only want an overview and actionable
            advice (i.e. use profiles as identities not inherently tied to each other).</p>

            <p>Apps can generate their own 128-bit or larger random value and use that as an
            identifier for the app installation. Apps can create data in their app-specific
            external storage directory by default without needing permission, and in the legacy
            storage model before API 29 that data persists after the app is uninstalled, so it can
            be used to store an ID that persists through the app being uninstalled and
            reinstalled. However, external storage is under control of the user and the user can
            delete this data at any time, including after uninstalling the app. In the modern
            storage model, this data is automatically removed when the app is uninstalled.
            GrapheneOS includes Seedvault as an OS backup service which must be explicitly
            enabled, and it has the option to automatically restore app data when an app is
            reinstalled, so it wouldn't lose track of it being the same profile.</p>

            <p>The <code>ANDROID_ID</code> string is a 64-bit random number, unique to each
            combination of profile and app signing key. The 64-bit limitation means it isn't
            particularly useful due to the possibility of collisions. It's tied to the lifetime of
            profiles and does not persist through profile deletion or a factory reset. This is
            comparable to an app targeting the legacy storage model storing a 64-bit random value
            in the app-specific external storage directory. In the future, GrapheneOS will likely
            change this to be tied to the lifetime of app installations rather than profiles. An
            app could still track the identity of the profile through data you give it access to or
            via data another app chooses to share with them.</p>

            <p>The advertising ID is a Google Play services feature not included in the baseline
            Android API, so it isn't an API included in GrapheneOS. The advertising ID is unique
            to each profile. It isn't unique to each app signing key like <code>ANDROID_ID</code>,
            but that makes little difference since apps within the same profile can communicate
            with each other with mutual consent. It's comparable to <code>ANDROID_ID</code> but
            provides an 128-bit value so it provides a strong cryptographic guarantee against
            collisions, although a device messing with apps could set it to the same value used in
            another profile. The advertising ID is exposed via the Settings app and can be reset
            to a new random value, unlike <code>ANDROID_ID</code> which remains the same for the
            lifetime of the profile, but apps can tie it the previous ID since they can detect
            that it changed via their own ID in their app data.</p>

            <p>Apps do not have access to user data by default and cannot ever access the data of
            other apps without those apps going out of the way to share it with them. If apps are
            granted read access to user data like media or contacts, they could use it to identify
            the profile. If apps are granted write access to user data, they could tag it to keep
            track of the profile. Apps previously had little reason to do things like this because
            they were able to persist data through an uninstall and reinstallation by default. The
            modern storage model means they need to request access to user data to do this. The
            existence of <code>ANDROID_ID</code> means they don't yet need to bother with that but
            that will change on GrapheneOS and will likely change for baseline Android too.
            However, profiles are the only way to provide a strong assurance of separate
            identities since the application model of the OS is designed to support communication
            between apps within the same profile, but never between them.</p>

                <a href="#cellular-tracking">What does GrapheneOS do about cellular tracking and
                silent SMS?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS always considers the network to be hostile and does not implement weak
            or useless mitigations. Therefore, it does not have the assorted gimmicks seen elsewhere
            providing privacy/security theatre to make users feel better about these issues. One
            of the core tenets of GrapheneOS is being honest with users and avoiding scams/frills
            based around marketing rather than real world privacy/security threat models.</p>

            <p>Activating airplane mode will fully disable the cellular radio transmit and receive
            capabilities, which will prevent your phone from being reached from the cellular
            network and stop your carrier (and anyone impersonating them to you) from tracking the
            device via the cellular radio. The baseband implements other functionality such as
            Wi-Fi and GPS functionality, but each of these components is separately sandboxed on
            the baseband and independent of each other. Enabling airplane mode disables the
            cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular
            radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device.</p>

            <p>The <a href="/usage#lte-only-mode">LTE-only mode added by GrapheneOS is solely
            intended for attack surface reduction</a>. It should not be mistaken as a way to make
            the cellular network into something that can be trusted.</p>

            <p>Even if interception of the connection or some other man-in-the-middle attack along
            the network is not currently occurring, the network is still untrustworthy and
            information should not be sent unencrypted. Legacy calls and texts should be avoided
            as they're not secure and trust the carrier / network along with having weak security
            against other parties. Trying to detect some forms of interception rather than dealing
            with the root of the problem (unencrypted communications / data transfer) would be
            foolish and doomed to failure.</p>

            <p>Receiving a silent SMS is not a good indicator of being targeted by your cell
            carrier, police or government because <em>anyone on the cell network can send
            them</em> including yourself. Cellular triangulation will happen regardless of whether
            or not SMS texts are being sent or received by the phone. Even if an SMS did serve a
            useful purpose for tracking, a silent SMS would be little different than receiving
            unsolicited spam. In fact, sending spam would be stealthier since it wouldn't trigger
            alerts for silent SMS but rather would be ignored with the rest of the spam. Regardless,
            sending texts or other data is not required or particularly useful to track devices
            connected to a network for an adversary with the appropriate access.</p>

                make by default?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>GrapheneOS makes connections to the outside world to test connectivity, detect
            captive portals and download updates. No data varying per user / installation / device
            is sent in these connections. There aren't analytics / telemetry in GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>The expected default connections by GrapheneOS (including all base system apps) are
            the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The GrapheneOS Updater app fetches update metadata from
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-CHANNEL approximately once every four hours
                    when connected to a permitted network for updates.</p>
                    <p>Once an update is available, it tries to download
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-incremental-OLD_VERSION-NEW_VERSION.zip
                    for a delta update, and then falls back to
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-ota_update-NEW_VERSION.zip.</p>
                    <p>No query / data is sent to the server, so the only information leaked to it
                    are the variables in these 3 URLs (device, channel, current version) which is
                    necessary to obtain the update.</p>
                    <p>Users are in control of which types of networks the Updater app will use
                    and can disable the Updater app in extreme cases. It's strongly recommended to
                    leave it enabled to quickly receive security updates including updates outside
                    the regular monthly schedule.</p>
                    <p>The update client avoids trusting the data obtained from the update server
                    via signature verification with downgrade protection. Verified boot provides
                    another layer of signature verification with downgrade protection. GrapheneOS
                    servers do not have access to GrapheneOS signing keys.</p>

                    <p>An HTTPS connection is made to https://time.grapheneos.org/ to update the
                    time from the date header field. This is a full replacement of Android's
                    standard network time update implementation, which uses the cellular network
                    when available with a fallback to SNTP when it's not available. Network time
                    updates are security sensitive since certificate validation depends on having
                    an accurate time, but the standard NTP / SNTP protocols used across most OSes
                    have no authentication.</p>

                    <p>We plan to offer a toggle to use the standard functionality instead of
                    HTTPS-based time updates in order to blend in with other devices.</p>

                    The time zone is still obtained directly via the time zone provided by the

                    <p>Connectivity checks designed to mimic a web browser user agent are performed
                    by using HTTP and HTTPS to fetch standard URLs generating an HTTP 204 status
                    code. This is used to detect when internet connectivity is lost on a network,
                    which triggers fallback to other available networks if possible. These checks
                    are designed to detect and handle captive portals which substitute the
                    expected empty 204 response with their own web page.</p>

                    <p>The connectivity checks are done by performing an empty GET request to a
                    server returning an empty response with a 204 No Content response code. The
                    request uses a standard, frozen value for the user agent matching the same
                    value used by billions of other Android devices:</p>

                    <p>No query / data is sent to the servers and the response is unused beyond
                    checking the response code.</p>

                    <p>By default, the GrapheneOS connectivity check server is used via the
                    following URLs:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>HTTPS: https://connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org/generate_204</li>

                        <li>HTTP other fallback: http://connectivity.grapheneos.org/generate_204</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can change the connectivity check URLs via the Settings ➔ Network &amp;
                    internet ➔ Advanced ➔ Internet connectivity check setting. At the moment, it
                    can be toggled between the GrapheneOS server and the standard Google servers
                    used by billions of other Android devices. This can be used to blend in with
                    other Android devices, both with and without Play services. Changing this to
                    the Standard (Google) mode will use the same URLs used by AOSP and the stock

            privacy-friendly Do Not Track (DNT) policy</a> for all users of our publicly available

            same with "DNT User" redefined as "user" to cover any user. This serves as a standard
            privacy policy across all of our public services:</p>

            <p>Our implementation of the policy primarily consists of making sure our servers only

            than the rules laid out in the EFF policy. However, we don't want to define our own
            complex, ad-hoc privacy policy rather than reusing a sensible one with serious thought

            <p>Our mail server (mail.grapheneos.org) isn't offered as a public service and doesn't

            <h3 id="default-dns">
                <a href="#default-dns">Which DNS servers are used by default?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>By default, the OS uses the network-provided DNS servers, whether those come from
            DHCP or static network configuration. VPNs provide their own DNS servers. If no DNS
            servers are provided, GrapheneOS uses <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/what-is-1.1.1.1/">Cloudflare DNS</a>
            as the fallback rather than Google Public DNS. In practice, the fallback is rarely used
            and has little real world impact.</p>

            <h3 id="custom-dns">
                <a href="#custom-dns">How do I use a custom DNS server?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>It isn't possible to directly override the DNS servers provided by the network via
            DHCP. Instead, use the Private DNS feature in Settings ➔ Network &amp; internet ➔
            Advanced ➔ Private DNS to set the hostname of a DNS-over-TLS server. It needs to have
            a valid certificate such as a free certificate from Let's Encrypt. The OS will look up
            the Private DNS hostname via the network provided DNS servers and will then force all
            other DNS requests through the Private DNS server. Unlike an option to override the
            network-provided DNS servers, this prevents the network from monitoring or tampering
            with DNS requests/responses.</p>

            <p>As an example, set the hostname to <code>one.one.one.one</code> for Cloudflare DNS.
            There are various other mainstream DNS-over-TLS options available including Quad9,
            Google and AdGuard.</p>

            <p>Configuring a static IP address for a network requires entering DNS servers
            manually, but you should still use the Private DNS feature with it, and you shouldn't
            misuse the static IP address option just to override the DNS servers.</p>

            <p>VPN service apps can also provide their own DNS implementation and/or servers,
            including an alternate implementation of encrypted DNS. Private DNS takes precedence
            over VPN-provided DNS, since it's just the network-provided DNS.</p>

            <p>Apps and web sites can detect the configured DNS servers by generating random
            subdomains resolved by querying their authoritative DNS server. This can be used as
            part of fingerprinting users. If you're using a VPN, you should consider using the
            standard DNS service provided by the VPN service to avoid standing out from other
            users.</p>

            <h3 id="private-dns-ip">
                <a href="#private-dns-ip">Why does Private DNS not accept IP addresses?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>By default, in the automatic mode, the Private DNS feature provides opportunistic
            encryption by using DNS-over-TLS when supported by the DNS server IP addresses
            provided by the network (DHCP) or the static IP configuration. Opportunistic
            encryption provides protection against a passive listener, not an active attacker,
            since they can force falling back to unencrypted DNS by blocking DNS-over-TLS. In the
            automatic mode, certificate validation is not enforced, as it would provide no
            additional security and would reduce the availability of opportunistic encryption.</p>

            <p>When Private DNS is explicitly enabled, it uses authenticated encryption without a
            fallback. The authentication is performed based on the hostname of the server, so it
            isn't possible to provide an IP address. The OS will look up the hostname of the Private
            DNS server via unencrypted DNS and then force all other DNS lookups via DNS-over-TLS
            with the identity of the server authenticated as part of providing authenticated
            encryption.</p>

            <h3 id="private-dns-other">
                <a href="#private-dns-other">Does DNS-over-TLS (Private DNS) protect other connections?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>No, it only provides privacy for DNS resolution. Even authenticating DNS results
            with DNSSEC does not protect other connections, unless the DNS records are part of the
            system used to provide authenticated encryption, and DNS-over-TLS is not a substitute
            for DNSSEC. If connections have authenticated encryption, they're secure even if DNS
            resolution is hijacked by an attacker. If connections do not have authenticated
            encryption, an attacker can listen in and tamper with them without hijacking DNS.
            There are other ways to perform a MITM attack than DNS hijacking and internet routing
            is fundamentally insecure. DNS-over-TLS may make a MITM harder for some attackers, but
            don't count on it at all.</p>

                <a href="#private-dns-visited">Does DNS-over-TLS (Private DNS) hide which sites are visited, etc.?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Private DNS only encrypts DNS, and an adversary monitoring connections can still
            see the IP address at the other end of those connections. Many domains resolve to
            ambiguous IP addresses, so encrypted DNS is part of what's required to take away a lot
            of the information leaked to adversaries. However, TLS currently leaks domains via
            SNI, so encrypted DNS is not yet accomplishing much. It's a forward looking feature
            that will become more useful in the future. Using it is recommended, but it's not an
            alternative to using Tor or a VPN.</p>

            <h3 id="vpn-support">
                <a href="#vpn-support">What kind of VPN and Tor support is available?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>VPNs can be configured under Settings ➔ Network &amp; Internet ➔ Advanced ➔ VPN.
            Support for the following protocols is included: PPTP (insecure, obsolete), L2TP/IPSec
            PSK, L2TP/IPSec RSA, IPSec Xauth PSK, IPSec Xauth RSA and IPSec Hybrid RSA. Apps can
            also provide userspace VPN implementations and the following open source apps are
            recommended: Orbot (Tor), WireGuard, OpenVPN for Android and the Private Internet
            Access client (OpenVPN).</p>

            <p>VPN configurations created with the built-in support can be set as the always-on
            VPN in the configuration panel. This will keep the VPN running, reconnecting as
            necessary and will force all connections through them. An app providing a VPN service
            can also be set as the always-on VPN via the entry in the Settings page. For app-based
            VPN implementations, there's also an additional "Block connections without VPN" toggle
            which is needed to prevent leaks when the app's VPN service isn't running.</p>

            <h3 id="network-monitoring">
                <a href="#network-monitoring">Can apps monitor network connections or statistics?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Apps cannot monitor network connections unless they're made into the active VPN
            service by the user. Apps cannot normally access network stats and cannot directly
            request access to them. However, app-based stats can be explicitly granted by users as
            part of access to app usage stats in Settings ➔ Apps &amp; notifications ➔ Special app
            access ➔ Usage access.</p>

            <p>This was previously part of the GrapheneOS privacy improvements, but became a
            standard Android feature with Android 10.</p>

            <h3 id="firewall">
                <a href="#firewall">Does GrapheneOS provide a firewall?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Yes, GrapheneOS inherits the deeply integrated firewall from the Android Open
            Source Project, which is used to implement portions of the security model and various
            other features. The GrapheneOS project historically made various improvements to the
            firewall but over time most of these changes have been integrated upstream or became
            irrelevant.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS adds a user-facing Network permission toggle providing a robust way to
            deny both direct and indirect network access to applications. It builds upon the
            standard non-user-facing INTERNET permission, so it's already fully adopted by the app
            ecosystem. Revoking the permission denies indirect access via OS components and apps
            enforcing the INTERNET permission, such as DownloadManager. Direct access is denied
            by blocking low-level network socket access.</p>

            <h3 id="ad-blocking">
                <a href="#ad-blocking">How can I set up system-wide ad-blocking?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The recommended approach to system-wide ad-blocking is setting up domain-based
            ad-blocking as part of DNS resolution. You can do this by
            <a href="#custom-dns">choosing a Private DNS (DNS-over-TLS) server</a> with support
            for blocking ad domains. As an example, AdGuard DNS can be used by setting
            <code>dns.adguard.com</code> as the Private DNS domain. In the future, GrapheneOS
            plans on adding back <a
            href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/184">an efficient
            user-defined blacklist for the local DNS resolver</a>. This feature used to be
            included by the project many years ago, but it needs to be reimplemented, and it's a
            low priority feature depending on contributors stepping up to work on it.</p>

            <p>Apps and web sites can detect that ad-blocking is being used and can determine
            what's being blocked. This can be used as part of fingerprinting users. Using a widely
            used service like AdGuard with a standard block list is much less of an issue than a
            custom set of subscriptions / rules, but it still stands out compared to the default
            of not doing it.</p>

            <h3 id="ad-blocking-apps">
                <a href="#ad-blocking-apps">Are ad-blocking apps supported?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Content filtering apps are fully compatible with GrapheneOS, but they have serious
            drawbacks and are not recommended. These apps use the VPN service feature to route
            traffic through themselves to perform filtering.</p>

            <p>The approach of intercepting traffic is inherently incompatible with encryption
            from the client to the server. The AdGuard app works around encryption by supporting
            optional
            <a href="https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/https-filtering">HTTPS interception</a> by
            having the user trust a local certificate authority, which is a security risk and
            weakens HTTPS security even if their implementation is flawless (which they openly
            acknowledge in their documentation, although it understates the risks). It also can't
            intercept connections using certificate pinning, with the exception of browsers which
            go out of the way to allow overriding pinning with locally added certificate
            authorities. Many of these apps only provide domain-based filtering, unlike the deeper
            filtering by AdGuard, but they're still impacted by encryption due to Private DNS
            (DNS-over-TLS) and require disabling the feature. They could provide their own
            DNS-over-TLS resolver to avoid losing the feature, but few of the developers care
            enough to do that.</p>

            <p>Using the VPN service to provide something other than a VPN also means that these
            apps need to provide an actual VPN implementation or a way to forward to apps
            providing one, and very few have bothered to implement this. NetGuard is an one
            example implementing SOCKS5 forwarding, which can be used to forward to apps like
            Orbot (Tor).</p>

            <h3 id="baseband-isolation">
                <a href="#baseband-isolation">Is the baseband isolated?</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Yes, the baseband is isolated on all of the officially supported devices. Memory
            access is partitioned by the IOMMU and limited to internal memory and memory shared
            by the driver implementations. The baseband on the officially supported devices with a
            Qualcomm SoC implements Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as internal sandboxed processes rather
            than having a separate baseband for those like earlier devices.</p>

            <p>Earlier generation devices we used to support prior to Pixels had Wi-Fi + Bluetooth
            implemented on a separate SoC. This was not properly contained by the stock OS and we
            put substantial work into addressing that problem. However, that work has been
            obsoleted now that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are provided by the SoC on the officially
            supported devices.</p>

            <p>A component being on a separate chip is orthogonal to whether it's isolated. In
            order to be isolated, the drivers need to treat it as untrusted. If it has DMA access
            that needs to be contained via IOMMU and the driver needs to treat the shared memory
            as untrusted, as it would data received another way. There's a lot of attack surface
            between the baseband and the kernel/userspace software stack connected to it. OS
            security is very relevant to containing hardware components including the radios and
            the vast majority of the attack surface is in software. The OS relies upon the
            hardware and firmware to be able to contain components but ends up being primarily
            responsible for it due to control over the configuration of shared memory and the
            complexity of the interface and the OS side implementation.</p>

            <p>The mobile Atheros Wi-Fi driver/firmware is primarily a SoftMAC implementation with
            the vast majority of the complexity in the driver rather than the firmware. The fully
            functional driver is massive and the firmware is quite small. Unfortunately, since the
            Linux kernel is monolithic and has no internal security boundaries, the attack surface
            is problematic and a HardMAC implementation with most complexity in the isolated
            firmware could be better than the status quo. An isolated driver would be ideal.</p>

                <a href="#anti-theft">Does GrapheneOS provide Factory Reset Protection?</a>
            </h2>

            <p>No, since this is strictly a theft deterrence feature, not a security feature, and
            the standard implementation depends on having the device tied to an account on an
            online service. The only advantage would be encouraging thieves to return a stolen
            device for a potential reward after realizing that it has no value beyond scrapping it
            for parts.</p>

            <p>Google's Factory Reset Protection ties devices to a Google account using a tiny,
            special region of persistent state not wiped by a factory reset. It prevents a thief
            from wiping the device to a fresh state for resale without being stuck at a screen for
            authenticating with the Google account persisted on the device after wiping.</p>

            <p>It would be possible to make an implementation not reliant upon an online service
            where the user has the option to enable Factory Reset Protection and is given a seed
            phrase required to use the device after wiping data from recovery. However, since this
            has no security value and the ability to deter theft is questionable, implementing
            this is an extremely low priority.</p>

            <p>Providing the option to disable wiping from recovery would be simpler, but would be
            incompatible with features designed to wipe data automatically in certain cases. This
            will not be implemented by GrapheneOS since it isn't a good approach and it conflicts
            with other planned features.</p>

            <h2 id="bundled-apps">
                <a href="#bundled-apps">Why aren't my favorite apps bundled with GrapheneOS?</a>
            </h2>

            <p>There are drawbacks to bundling apps into the OS and few advantages in most cases.
            Rather than GrapheneOS bundling a bunch of apps, it makes far more sense for users to
            install their preferred apps via F-Droid, Aurora Store or other sources. GrapheneOS is
            also working on designing and implementing a first party app update system for a first
            party repository with higher robustness and security than the existing options. Rather
            than bundling apps, it could just offer recommendations as part of an initial setup
            wizard. Users have unique needs and preferences and there has to be a very compelling
            reason to bundle additional apps with the OS. For example, it's useful to have the
            Auditor app available before connecting to the internet (see the
            <a href="/install#verifying-installation">installation guide</a> documentation on
            this).</p>

            <p>Bundling additional apps with the OS can increase attack surface, unless users go
            out of the way to disable apps they aren't using. Bundling an app into the base OS is
            also painful to reverse, since removing the app without implementing a migration
            mechanism will lose user data stored in the app. Some users are also going to take
            issue with the choices made by the project or will want to make suggestions for
            bundling more apps, and having this as a regular topic of discussion and debate is
            unproductive and distracts from the real work of the project. Each bundled app also
            increases the size of the base OS, and shipping the app updates as part of the OS
            updates results in more overall bandwidth usage. It would be possible to ship only
            out-of-band app updates to avoid wasted bandwidth for apps users have disabled, but
            then the apps would be temporarily out-of-date and vulnerable to patched security
            issues after a factory reset or the user re-enabling them. If the updates aren't going
            to be shipped with the OS, it really makes no sense to bundle them.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS is focused on making meaningful improvements to privacy and security,
            and bundling assorted apps into the OS is not only usually outside of that focus but
            often counter to it.</p>

            <p>In some cases, licensing is also an issue. GrapheneOS is permissively licensed and
            is usable for building devices with an immutable root of trust. GPLv3 is deliberately
            incompatible with these kinds of locked down devices, unlike GPLv2 code such as the
            Linux kernel. This means GrapheneOS can't include GPLv3 code without forbidding use
            cases we want to support. GPLv3 is no problem for our own usage, but we don't want to
            forbid using GrapheneOS as a replacement for the Android Open Source Project in locked
            down devices.</p>
