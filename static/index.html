            <p>GrapheneOS is a privacy / security research and engineering project that has been
            under way for over 5 years. It recently became rebranded as GrapheneOS and is taking a
            different direction based on obtaining funding for the research and development work
            as a non-profit open source project rather than being a company. The reborn project is
            still in a very early stage and lots of the past work on privacy and security has not
            yet been restored for the new incarnation of the OS.</p>
            <p>The grapheneos.org site is very new and is currently being put together. It will
            have lots of additional documentation and tutorials in the future along with coverage
            of various software, firmware and hardware privacy/security topics.</p>
            <p>GrapheneOS is being supported with funding and developers from various companies
            and other organizations interested in contributing to this shared base for a feature
            rich private and secure mobile operating system able to run many existing
            applications. It will take more time to organize and deploy these resources in order
            for the project to have a strong development team with proper infrastructure behind
            it.</p>
            <h2 id="roadmap">
                Roadmap
                <a href="#roadmap">¶</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Details on the roadmap of the project will be posted on the site in the near
            future. In the long term, it aims to move beyond a hardened fork of the Android Open
            Source Project. Achieving the goals requires moving away from relying the Linux kernel
            as the core of the OS and foundation of the security model. It needs to move towards a
            microkernel-based model with a Linux compatibility layer, with many stepping stones
            leading towards that goal including adopting virtualization-based isolation.</p>
            <p>Hardware and firmware security are core parts of the project, but it's currently
            limited to research and submitting suggestions and bug reports upstream. In the long
            term, the project will need to move into the hardware space.</p>
            <h2 id="device-support">
                Device support
                <a href="#device-support">¶</a>
            </h2>
            <p>In the current early stage of the project, GrapheneOS provides production releases
            for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. It will support
            other devices in the future, but devices are carefully chosen based on their merits
            rather than the project aiming to have broad device support. Broad device support is
            counter to the aims of the project, and the project will eventually be engaging in
            hardware and firmware level improvements rather than only offering suggestions and bug
            reports upstream for those areas. Much of the work on the project involves changes
            that are specific to different devices, and officially supported devices are the ones
            targeted by most of this ongoing work. GrapheneOS also has source level support
            without device-specific hardening for the Android emulator, HiKey, HiKey 960 and also
            generic targets providing basic support for many other devices.</p>
            <p>Devices need to be meet the standards of the project in order to be considered as
            potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems,
            standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified
            boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available.
            Devices with support for alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be
            considered.  Devices need to have proper ongoing support for their firmware and
            software specific to the hardware like drivers in order to provide proper full
            security updates too. Devices that are end-of-life and no longer receiving these
            updates will not be supported.</p>
            <p>In order to support a device, the appropriate resources also need to be available
            and dedicated towards it. Releases for each supported device need to be robust and
            stable, with all standard functionality working properly and testing for each of the
            releases.</p>
            <p>Hardware, firmware and software specific to devices like drivers play a huge role
            in the overall security of a device. The goal of the project is not to slightly
            improve some aspects of insecure devices and supporting a broad set of devices would
            be directly counter to the values of the project. A lot of the low-level work also
            ends up being fairly tied to the hardware.</p>
            <p>Some of the GrapheneOS sub-projects support other operating systems on a broader
            range of devices. Device support for Auditor and AttestationServer is documented in
            the <a href="https://attestation.app/about">overview of those projects</a>. The
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS">hardened_malloc</a> project supports nearly
            any Linux-based environment due to official support for musl, glibc and Bionic along
            with easily added support for other environments. It can easily run on non-Linux-based
            operating systems too, and supporting some like HardenedBSD is planned but depends on
            contributors from those communities.</p>
