                    <p>GrapheneOS is a privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app
                    compatibility developed as a non-profit <a href="/source">open source</a>
                    project. It's focused on the research and development of privacy and security
                    technology including substantial improvements to sandboxing, exploit
                    mitigations and the permission model. It was founded in 2014 and was
                    <a href="/history/copperheados">formerly known as CopperheadOS</a>.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of the OS from the bottom up.
                    It deploys technologies to mitigate whole classes of vulnerabilities and make
                    exploiting the most common sources of vulnerabilities substantially more
                    difficult. It improves the security of both the OS and the apps running on it.
                    The app sandbox and other security boundaries are fortified. GrapheneOS tries
                    to avoid impacting the user experience with the privacy and security features.
                    Ideally, the features can be designed so that they're always enabled with no
                    impact on the user experience and no additional complexity like configuration
                    options. It's not always feasible, and GrapheneOS does add various toggles for
                    features like the Network permission, Sensors permission, restrictions when
                    the device is locked (USB peripherals, camera, quick tiles), etc. along with
                    more complex user-facing privacy and security features with their own UX.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="/features">features page</a> provides an overview of the
                    substantial privacy and security improvements added by GrapheneOS to the
                    Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Many of our past features were <a
                    href="/faq#upstream">contributed to AOSP, Linux and other projects to improve
                    privacy and security for billions of users</a> so they're no longer listed on
                    our features page.</p>

                    <p>Official releases are available on the <a href="/releases">releases
                    page</a> and installation instructions are on the <a href="/install/">install
                    page</a>.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also develops various apps and services with a focus on privacy
                    and security. Vanadium is a hardened variant of the Chromium browser and
                    WebView specifically built for GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS also includes our
                    minimal security-focused PDF Viewer, our hardware-based Auditor app /
                    attestation service providing local and remote verification of devices,
                    our modern privacy / security focused camera app, and the externally developed
                    Seedvault encrypted backup which was initially developed for inclusion in
                    GrapheneOS.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another
                    implementation of Google services like microG. It's possible to install Play
