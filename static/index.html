            </h2>
            <p>GrapheneOS is a privacy / security research and engineering project that has been
            under way for over 5 years. It recently became rebranded as GrapheneOS and is taking a
            different direction based on obtaining funding for the research and development work
            as a non-profit open source project rather than being a company. The reborn project is
            still in a very early stage and lots of the past work on privacy and security has not
            yet been restored for the new incarnation of the OS.</p>
            <p>The grapheneos.org site is still being put together. It will have lots of
            additional documentation and tutorials in the future along with coverage of various
            software, firmware and hardware privacy/security topics.</p>
            <p>GrapheneOS is being supported with funding and developers from various companies
            and other organizations interested in contributing to this shared base for a feature
            rich private and secure mobile operating system able to run many existing
            applications. It will take more time to organize and deploy these resources in order
            for the project to have a strong development team with proper infrastructure behind
            it.</p>
            <h2 id="roadmap">
                <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Details on the roadmap of the project will be posted on the site in the near
            future. In the long term, it aims to move beyond a hardened fork of the Android Open
            Source Project. Achieving the goals requires moving away from relying the Linux kernel
            as the core of the OS and foundation of the security model. It needs to move towards a
            microkernel-based model with a Linux compatibility layer, with many stepping stones
            leading towards that goal including adopting virtualization-based isolation.</p>
            <p>The initial phase for the long-term roadmap of moving away from the current
            foundation will be to deploy and integrate a hypervisor like Xen to leverage it for
            reinforcing existing security boundaries. Linux would be running inside the virtual
            machines at this point, inside and outside of the sandboxes being reinforced. In the
            longer term, Linux inside the sandboxes can be replaced with a compatibility layer
            like gVisor, which would need to be ported to arm64 and given a new backend alongside
            the existing KVM backend. Over the longer term, i.e. many years from now, Linux can
            fade away completely and so can the usage of virtualization. The anticipation is that
            many other projects are going to be interested in this kind of migration, so it's not
            going to be solely a GrapheneOS project, as demonstrated by the current existence of
            the gVisor project and various other projects working on virtualization deployments
            for mobile. Having a hypervisor with verified boot still intact will also provide a
            way to achieve some of the goals based on extensions to Trusted Execution Environment
            (TEE) functionality even without having GrapheneOS hardware.</p>
            <p>Hardware and firmware security are core parts of the project, but it's currently
            limited to research and submitting suggestions and bug reports upstream. In the long
            term, the project will need to move into the hardware space.</p>
