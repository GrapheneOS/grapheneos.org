            <h1><a href="#grapheneos">GrapheneOS</a></h1>

            <p>GrapheneOS is a privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app
            compatibility developed as a non-profit <a href="/source">open source</a> project.
            It's focused on the research and development of privacy and security technology
            including substantial improvements to sandboxing, exploit mitigations and the
            permission model. GrapheneOS also develops various apps and services with a focus on
            privacy and security. Vanadium is a hardened variant of the Chromium browser and
            WebView specifically built for GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS also includes our minimal
            security-focused PDF Viewer, our hardware-based Auditor app / attestation service
            providing local and remote verification of devices, and the externally developed
            Seedvault encrypted backup which was initially developed for inclusion in
            GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of the OS from the bottom up. It
            deploys technologies to mitigate whole classes of vulnerabilities and make exploiting
            the most common sources of vulnerabilities substantially more difficult. It improves
            the security of both the OS and the apps running on it. The app sandbox and other
            security boundaries are fortified. GrapheneOS tries to avoid impacting the user
            experience with the privacy and security features. Ideally, the features can be
            designed so that they're always enabled with no impact on the user experience and no
            additional complexity like configuration options. It's not always feasible, and
            GrapheneOS does add various toggles for features like the Network permission, Sensors
            permission, restrictions when the device is locked (USB peripherals, camera, quick
            tiles), etc. along with more complex user-facing privacy and security features with
            their own UX.</p>

            <p>The <a href="/features">features page</a> provides an overview of the substantial
            privacy and security improvements added by GrapheneOS to the Android Open Source
            Project.</p>

            <p>Official releases are available on the <a href="/releases">releases page</a> and
            installation instructions are on the <a href="/install/">install page</a>.</p>

            <section id="never-google-services">
                <h2><a href="#never-google-services">No Google apps or services</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another implementation
                of Google services like microG. Those are not part of the Android Open Source Project
                and are not required for baseline Android compatibility. Apps designed to run on
                Android rather than only Android with bundled Google apps and services already work on
                GrapheneOS, so a huge number of both open and closed source apps are already available
                for it.</p>

                <p>AOSP APIs not tied to Google but that are typically provided via Play services will
                continue to be implemented using open source providers like the Seedvault backup app.
                Text-to-speech, speech-to-text, non-GPS-based location services, geocoding,
                accessibility services, etc. are examples of other open Android APIs where we need to
                develop/bundle an implementation based on existing open source projects. GrapheneOS is
                not going to be implementing these via a Google service compatibility layer because
                these APIs are in no way inherently tied to Google services.</p>

                <p>We're developing support for installing microG as a regular app without any special
                privileges. This will allow users to choose to use a partial reimplementation of Play
                services in a specific profile. We won't be supporting arbitrary signature spoofing by
                microG or any other app since it seriously compromises the OS security model. Guarding
                it by a permission isn't enough, both because users don't understand the substantial
                impact on the security model and it weakens security for the verified boot threat
                model where persistent state such as granted permissions is controlled by an attacker.
                Instead, the OS will specifically make microG signed with our microG signing key
                appear to other apps as signed with the Google Play services key. It won't bypass any
                other signature checks, only a check for Play services, and other apps also won't be
                able to pretend to be Play services to intercept FCM messages, obtain Google
                credentials, etc. It will not be granted any privileged permissions or other special
                capabilities unavailable to a regular untrusted app.</p>

                <p>In the longer term, we also plan to offer a more minimal compatibility layer which
                pretends that Google services are offline rather than implementing them. Users will
                have the choice between no implementation of Play services, microG and this minimal
                implementation not implementing Google services. This choice will be available because
                we won't be bundling any of this into the OS. Ideally, Google themselves would support
                installing the official Play services as a regular Android app, rather than taking the
                monopolistic approach of forcing it to be bundled into the OS in a deeply integrated
                way with special privileged permissions and capabilities unavailable to other cloud
                service providers competing with them.</p>

            <section id="history">
                <h2><a href="#history">History</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS was founded by Daniel Micay in late 2014. It started as a solo project
                incorporating his previous open source privacy/security work. The project initially
                created a port of OpenBSD malloc to Android's Bionic libc and a port of the PaX kernel
                patches to the kernels for the supported devices. It quickly expanded to having a
                large set of homegrown privacy and security improvements, particularly low-level
                hardening work on the compiler toolchain and Bionic. Work began on landing code
                upstream in AOSP and other upstream projects. A substantial portion of these early
                changes were either successfully landed upstream or heavily influenced the upstream
                changes which replaced them. The project was able to move very quickly in these days
                because there was so much low hanging fruit to address and it wasn't yet trying to
                produce a highly robust, production quality OS.</p>

                <p>In late 2015, a company was incorporated which became the primary sponsor of the
                project. GrapheneOS was previously known as CopperheadOS while it was sponsored by
                this company. The intention was to use the company to build a business around
                GrapheneOS selling support, contract work and customized proprietary variants of the
                OS. The company was supposed to serve the needs of the open source project, rather
                than vice versa. It was explicitly agreed that GrapheneOS would remain
                independently owned and controlled by Daniel Micay. This company failed to live up
                the promises and is no longer associated in any way with GrapheneOS. The company
                ended up holding back the open source project and taking far more from it than was
                provided to it.</p>

                <p>In 2018, the company was hijacked by the CEO who attempted to take over the project
                through coercion, but they were rebuked. They seized the infrastructure and stole the
                donations, but the project successfully moved on without them and has been fully
                revived. Since then, they've taken to fraudulently claiming ownership and authorship
                of our work, which has no basis in fact. They've tried to retroactively change the
                terms of their involvement and rewrite the history of the project. These claims are
                easily falsified through the public record and by people involved with the open source
                project and the former sponsor. This former sponsor has engaged in a campaign of
                misinformation and harassment of contributors to the project. Be aware that they are
                actively trying to sabotage GrapheneOS and are engaging in many forms of attacks
                against the project, the developers, contributors and supporters. Meanwhile, they
                continue profiting from our open source work which they falsely claim as their own
                creation.</p>

                <p>After splitting from the former sponsor, the project was rebranded to
                AndroidHardening and then to GrapheneOS and it has continued down the original path of
                being an independent open source project. It will never again be closely tied to any
                particular sponsor or company.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS now has multiple full-time and part-time developers supported by
                donations and multiple companies collaborating with the project.</p>

            <section id="upstream">
                <h2><a href="#upstream">Upstream contributions</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS has made substantial contributions to the privacy and security of the
                Android Open Source Project, along with contributions to the Linux kernel, LLVM,
                OpenBSD and other projects. Much of our past work is no longer part of the downstream
                GrapheneOS project because we've successfully landed many patches upstream. We've had
                even more success with making suggestions and participating in design discussions to
                steer things in the direction we want. Many upstream changes in AOSP such as removing
                app access to low-level process, network, timing and profiling information originated
                in the GrapheneOS project. The needs of the upstream projects are often different from
                ours, so they'll often reimplement the features in a more flexible way. We've almost
                always been able to move to using the upstream features and even when we still need
                our own implementation it helps to have the concepts/restrictions considered by the
                upstream project and apps needing to be compatible with it. Getting features upstream
                often leads to an improved user experience and app compatibility.</p>
