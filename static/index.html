            <h1><a href="#grapheneos">GrapheneOS</a></h1>

            <p>GrapheneOS is a privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app
            compatibility developed as a non-profit <a href="/source">open source</a> project.
            It's focused on the research and development of privacy and security technology
            including substantial improvements to sandboxing, exploit mitigations and the
            permission model.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of the OS from the bottom up. It
            deploys technologies to mitigate whole classes of vulnerabilities and make exploiting
            the most common sources of vulnerabilities substantially more difficult. It improves
            the security of both the OS and the apps running on it. The app sandbox and other
            security boundaries are fortified. GrapheneOS tries to avoid impacting the user
            experience with the privacy and security features. Ideally, the features can be
            designed so that they're always enabled with no impact on the user experience and no
            additional complexity like configuration options. It's not always feasible, and
            GrapheneOS does add various toggles for features like the Network permission, Sensors
            permission, restrictions when the device is locked (USB peripherals, camera, quick
            tiles), etc. along with more complex user-facing privacy and security features with
            their own UX.</p>

            <p>The <a href="/features">features page</a> provides an overview of the substantial
            privacy and security improvements added by GrapheneOS to the Android Open Source
            Project.</p>

            <p>Official releases are available on the <a href="/releases">releases page</a> and
            installation instructions are on the <a href="/install/">install page</a>.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS also develops various apps and services with a focus on privacy and
            security. Vanadium is a hardened variant of the Chromium browser and WebView
            specifically built for GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS also includes our minimal
            security-focused PDF Viewer, our hardware-based Auditor app / attestation service
            providing local and remote verification of devices, and the externally developed
            Seedvault encrypted backup which was initially developed for inclusion in
            GrapheneOS.</p>

                <h2><a href="#never-google-services">No Google apps or services</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another
                implementation of Google services like microG. It's possible to install Play
                services as a set of fully sandboxed apps without special privileges via our
                <a href="/usage#sandboxed-play-services">sandboxed Play services compatibility
                layer</a>. See <a href="/faq#google-services">the FAQ section</a> for more details
                on our plans for filling in the gaps from not shipping Play services and Google
                apps.</p>
