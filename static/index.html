            <p>GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android
            app compatibility. It's focused on the research and development of privacy and
            security technology including substantial improvements to sandboxing, exploit
            mitigations and the permission model. GrapheneOS also develops various apps and
            services with a focus on privacy and security.</p>
            <p>GrapheneOS is a collaborative open source project, not a company. It's used and
            supported by a variety of companies and other organizations. It won't be closely tied
            to any company in particular. There will eventually be a non-profit GrapheneOS
            foundation, but for now the developers represent the project.</p>
            <p>GrapheneOS has made substantial contributions to the privacy and security of the
            Android Open Source Project, along with contributions to the Linux kernel, LLVM,
            OpenBSD and other projects.</p>
            <p>Official releases are available on the <a href="/releases">releases page</a> and
            installation instructions are on the <a href="/install">install page</a>.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS">GitHub organization</a> for sources
            of the OS and various standalone sub-projects including the cutting edge
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md">new
            hardened memory allocator</a> and other projects.</p>
            <p>The official GrapheneOS releases are supported by the
            <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases">Auditor app</a> and
            <a href="https://attestation.app/">attestation service</a> for hardware-based
            attestation. For more details, see the <a

            </h2>
            <p>GrapheneOS was founded by Daniel Micay in late 2014. It started as a solo project
            and was subsequently sponsored by a company that is no longer associated with it. The
            copyright for GrapheneOS code is entirely owned by the GrapheneOS developers and is
            made available under OSI-approved Open Source licenses. All of the code written by
            people under contract with the former sponsor was removed from the project due to the
            code becoming obsolete, long before it was known as GrapheneOS. The code that remains
            from the previous era is entirely owned by Daniel Micay, was never written under any
            contracts or employment agreements, was never assigned to any company or organization
            and was the continuation of the original independent open source project. The former
            sponsor attempted to take over the project through coercion, but they were rebuked,
            and since then they've taken to fraudulently claiming ownership and authorship of our
            work which has no basis in fact. The former sponsor has engaged in a campaign of
            misinformation and harassment of contributors to the project. Be aware that they are
            actively trying to sabotage it through any means necessary to support their failing
            business. This paragraph was reluctantly included here despite wanting to move
            forwards and will be expanded if necessary.</p>
            <h2 id="roadmap">
                <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Details on the roadmap of the project will be posted on the site in the near
            future.</p>
            <p>To get an idea of the near term roadmap, check out the
            <a href="/contact#reporting-issues">issue trackers</a>. The vast majority of the
            issues filed in the trackers are planned enhancements, with care taken to make sure
            all of the issues open in the tracker are concrete and actionable.</p>
            <p>In the long term, it aims to move beyond a hardened fork of the Android Open
            Source Project. Achieving the goals requires moving away from relying the Linux kernel
            as the core of the OS and foundation of the security model. It needs to move towards a
            microkernel-based model with a Linux compatibility layer, with many stepping stones
            leading towards that goal including adopting virtualization-based isolation.</p>
            <p>The initial phase for the long-term roadmap of moving away from the current
            foundation will be to deploy and integrate a hypervisor like Xen to leverage it for
            reinforcing existing security boundaries. Linux would be running inside the virtual
            machines at this point, inside and outside of the sandboxes being reinforced. In the
            longer term, Linux inside the sandboxes can be replaced with a compatibility layer
            like gVisor, which would need to be ported to arm64 and given a new backend alongside
            the existing KVM backend. Over the longer term, i.e. many years from now, Linux can
            fade away completely and so can the usage of virtualization. The anticipation is that
            many other projects are going to be interested in this kind of migration, so it's not
            going to be solely a GrapheneOS project, as demonstrated by the current existence of
            the gVisor project and various other projects working on virtualization deployments
            for mobile. Having a hypervisor with verified boot still intact will also provide a
            way to achieve some of the goals based on extensions to Trusted Execution Environment
            (TEE) functionality even without having GrapheneOS hardware.</p>
            <p>Hardware and firmware security are core parts of the project, but it's currently
            limited to research and submitting suggestions and bug reports upstream. In the long
            term, the project will need to move into the hardware space.</p>
