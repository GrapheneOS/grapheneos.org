            <h1><a href="#history">History</a></h1>

            <p>GrapheneOS was founded by Daniel Micay in late 2014. It started as a solo project
            incorporating his previous open source privacy/security work. The project initially
            created a port of OpenBSD malloc to Android's Bionic libc and a port of the PaX kernel
            patches to the kernels for the supported devices. It quickly expanded to having a
            large set of homegrown privacy and security improvements, particularly low-level
            hardening work on the compiler toolchain and Bionic. Work began on landing code
            upstream in AOSP and other upstream projects. A substantial portion of these early
            changes were either successfully landed upstream or heavily influenced the upstream
            changes which replaced them. The project was able to move very quickly in these days
            because there was so much low hanging fruit to address and it wasn't yet trying to
            produce a highly robust, production quality OS.</p>

            <p>In late 2015, a company was incorporated which became the primary sponsor of the
            project. GrapheneOS was <a href="/history/copperheados">previously known as
            CopperheadOS</a> while it was sponsored by this company. The intention was to use the
            company to build a business around GrapheneOS selling support, contract work and
            customized proprietary variants of the OS. The company was supposed to serve the needs
            of the open source project, rather than vice versa. It was explicitly agreed that
            GrapheneOS would remain independently owned and controlled by Daniel Micay. This
            company failed to live up the promises and is no longer associated in any way with
            GrapheneOS. The company ended up holding back the open source project and taking far
            more from it than was provided to it.</p>

            <p>In 2018, the company was hijacked by the CEO who attempted to take over the project
            through coercion, but they were rebuked. They seized the infrastructure and stole the
            donations, but the project successfully moved on without them and has been fully
            revived. Since then, they've taken to fraudulently claiming ownership and authorship
            of our work, which has no basis in fact. They've tried to retroactively change the
            terms of their involvement and rewrite the history of the project. These claims are
            easily falsified through the public record and by people involved with the open source
            project and the former sponsor. This former sponsor has engaged in a campaign of
            misinformation and harassment of contributors to the project. Be aware that they are
            actively trying to sabotage GrapheneOS and are engaging in many forms of attacks
            against the project, the developers, contributors and supporters. Meanwhile, they
            continue profiting from our open source work which they falsely claim as their own
            creation.</p>

            <p>After splitting from the former sponsor, the project was rebranded to
            AndroidHardening and then to GrapheneOS and it has continued down the original path of
            being an independent open source project. It will never again be closely tied to any
            particular sponsor or company.</p>

            <p>GrapheneOS now has multiple full-time and part-time developers supported by
            donations and multiple companies collaborating with the project.</p>
