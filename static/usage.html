                <h2><a href="#system-navigation">System navigation</a></h2>

                <p>By default, GrapheneOS uses gesture-based navigation. We recommend reading our
                guide on gesture navigation and giving it a chance even if you think you won't
                like it. Our experience is that when armed with the appropriate knowledge, the
                vast majority of users prefer the newer gesture navigation approach.</p>

                <p>The system navigation mode can be configured in <b>Settings&#160;> System&#160;>
                Gestures&#160;> Navigation
                mode</b>. The same menu is also available in <b>Settings&#160;>
                Accessibility&#160;> System
                controls&#160;> Navigation mode</b>.</p>

                <section id="gesture-navigation">
                    <h3><a href="#gesture-navigation">Gesture navigation</a></h3>

                    <p>The bottom of the screen is a reserved touch zone for system navigation. A
                    line is displayed in the center to show that the navigation bar is present
                    across the entire bottom of the screen. In most apps, this area will display
                    padding. Modern apps are able to tell the OS that they can handle not having
                    the padding to display app content there while still not being able to receive
                    touches from it. Open up the Settings app for an example.</p>

                    <p>Swiping up from the navigation bar while removing your finger from the
                    screen is the <strong>Home</strong> gesture.</p>

                    <p>Swiping up from the navigation bar while holding your finger on the screen
                    before releasing is the <strong>Recent Apps</strong> gesture. The most
                    recently opened activity is always on the furthest right. Each step left goes
                    one step back through the history of recently opened apps. Opening an app with
                    the recent apps activity will place it on the furthest right in the recent
                    apps order just like a new app being opened.</p>

                    <p>The recent apps activity has a screenshot button as an alternative to
                    holding power and volume down while using an app.</p>

                    <p>Rather than opening the recent apps activity, you can swipe left on the
                    navigation bar for the <strong>Previous</strong> app and swipe right for the
                    <strong>Next</strong> app. This will not change the recent apps order. This is
                    usually the best way to navigate through recent apps.</p>

                    <p>Swiping from either the left or the right of the screen within the app (not
                    the navigation bar) is the <strong>Back</strong> gesture. Apps are supposed to
                    avoid implementing conflicting gestures, but have the option to override this
                    gesture if they truly need to get rid of it. Some legacy apps without active
                    development of their UI still haven't addressed this despite gestures being
                    the default for several years on Google Android. You can avoid triggering the
                    back gesture in one of 2 easy ways: avoid swiping from right near the edge or
                    hold your finger on the side of the screen for a moment before swiping. The
                    more advanced option is using a diagonal swipe pointing sharply to the bottom
                    of the screen since this will bypass the back gesture but will still trigger
                    most app gestures. The advanced option is the most convenient approach once
                    you get used to doing it.</p>

                    <p>The launcher uses a swipe up gesture starting anywhere on the screen to
                    open the app drawer from the home screen. You need to start that gesture above
                    the system navigation bar since any gesture starting on the navigation bar is
                    handled by the OS as a system navigation gesture.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="3-button-navigation">
                    <h3><a href="#3-button-navigation">3-button navigation</a></h3>

                    <p>3-button navigation is Android's oldest touchscreen-based navigation
                    system. It will remain supported for the foreseeable future to provide
                    accessibility for users unable to easily use the gestures. It's older than
                    2-button navigation but isn't considered a legacy feature.</p>

                    <p>A large row across the bottom of the screen is reserved for navigation
                    buttons. The <strong>Back</strong> button is on the left, the
                    <strong>Home</strong> button is in the center and the <strong>Recent
                    Apps</strong> button is on the right.</p>

                    <p>In the recent apps activity, the most recently opened activity is always on
                    the furthest right. Each step left goes one step back through the history of
                    recently opened apps. Opening an app with the recent apps activity will place
                    it on the furthest right in the recent apps order just like a new app being
                    opened.</p>

                    <p>The recent apps activity has a screenshot button as an alternative to
                    holding power and volume down while using an app.</p>

            <section id="storage-access">
                <h2><a href="#storage-access">Storage access</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS inherits the same baseline approach to storage access as modern
                Android and extends it with our Storage Scopes feature as a fully compatible
                alternative to standard Android storage permissions. This section provides an
                overview of the standard approach to storage access primarily to provide context
                for explaining Storage Scopes.</p>

                <p>There are two types of app-accessible storage:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>app-private ("internal") storage:
                        <ul>
                            <li>inaccessible to other apps</li>
                            <li>doesn't require any permission for full access</li>
                            <li>cleared when the app is uninstalled</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>shared ("external") storage:
                        <ul>
                            <li>shared with other apps</li>
                            <li>access is regulated with permissions</li>
                            <li>files persist after uninstallation</li>
                        </ul>
                        Android/data/ and Android/obb/ directories aren't considered to be parts
                        of shared storage.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>For modern apps, access to the shared storage is controlled in the following way:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Without any storage permission, an app is allowed to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>create media files in standard directories (audio in Music/,
                                Ringtones/, etc, images in Pictures/ and DCIM/, videos in DCIM/
                                and Movies/)</li>
                            <li>create files of any type (both media and non-media) in Documents/
                                and Download/</li>
                            <li>create new directories inside standard directories</li>
                            <li>rename/delete files that were created by the app itself</li>
                            <li>rename/delete directories if it can rename/delete all files within
                                those directories</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Media access permission ("Allow access to media only",
                        <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>) allows the app to read media files
                        that were created by other apps. Non-media files remain invisible to it.
                        For apps targeting Android 13, the media access permission is split into
                        <code>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code>, <code>READ_MEDIA_VIDEO</code> and
                        <code>READ_MEDIA_AUDIO</code>.</li>
                    <li>Media management special access permission ("Allow app to manage media",
                        <code>MANAGE_MEDIA</code>) allows the app to delete and to rename media
                        files created by other apps.</li>
                    <li>"All files access" special access permission (<code>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>)
                        allows the app to read, create, rename and delete files and directories
                        of any type in any directory of the shared storage (including the root
                        directory).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For legacy apps (those that target Android 9 or lower and those that target
                Android 10 and request legacy storage mode), storage access permissions have
                a different meaning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Without a storage permission, app is not allowed any type of access to
                        any files or directories inside the shared storage.</li>
                    <li><code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission allows the app to read both
                    media and non-media files in any directory.</li>
                    <li><code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission allows the app to create,
                    rename and delete files (of any type) and directories in any directory of
                    shared storage (including the root directory).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additionally, both modern and legacy Android apps can open the system file
                picker interface to have the user store or load one or more files/directories on
                their behalf. This type of access doesn't require any of the permissions listed
                above. Using this approach gives the user control over where files are stored in
                their home directory and which files/directories can be used by the app. This is
                based on the Storage Access Framework (SAF) introduced in Android 4.4. SAF allows
                the user to grant access to files/directories in their home directory, external
                drives and also app-based storage providers such as network shares, cloud storage,
                an encrypted volume, an external drive with a filesystem the OS doesn't support
                for external drives, etc. This is the only way to use those app-based storage
                providers and modern Android has removed the legacy approach for accessing
                external drives.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#storage-scopes">Storage Scopes</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS provides the Storage Scopes feature as a fully compatible alternative
                    to the standard Android storage permissions.
                    Storage Scopes can be enabled only if the app doesn't have any storage permission.
                    Enabling Storage Scopes makes the app assume that it has all of storage permissions
                    that were requested by it, despite not actually having any of them.</p>

                    <p>This means that the app can't see any of the files that were created by other apps.
                    The app is still allowed to create files and directories, same as any other modern
                    app that doesn't have any storage access permission.</p>

                    <p>Apps that would normally use the legacy storage mode are switched to the
                    modern storage mode when Storage Scopes is enabled.</p>

                    <p>If the app requests the "All files access" permission (or is a legacy app
                    that requests <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission), then the write
                    restrictions that are normally applied to apps that don't have a storage access
                    permission are relaxed to provide the same write access that the app would have if
                    it was granted the "All files access" permission.
                    This is done to ensure compatibility with apps that, for example, create a new
                    directory in the root of shared storage, or write a text file (eg lyrics.txt) to
                    the Music/ directory (normally, only audio files can be placed there).
                    No additional read access is granted to such apps, they still can see only their
                    own files.
                    </p>

                    <p>For all other apps, enabling Storage Scopes doesn't grant any additional
                    storage access beyond what a modern app that doesn't have any storage permission
                    already has.</p>

                    <p>Optionally, users can specify which of the files created by other apps the app
                    can access. Access can be granted to a specific file or to all files in
                    a directory. The standard SAF picker is used for this purpose in a special mode
                    where it shows only shared storage files/directories.</p>

                    <p>The most significant limitation of Storage Scopes is the fact that the app
                    will lose access to files that it created if it's uninstalled and then installed
                    again, same as any other app that doesn't have a storage access permission.
                    As a workaround, users can manually grant access to these files/directories via
                    SAF picker.</p>

                <h2><a href="#contact-scopes">Contact Scopes</a></h2>

                <p>On Android, contact access is controlled with an all-or-nothing Contacts permission, which grants
                both read and write access to all contacts stored on the device.</p>

                <p>A lot of apps (e.g. popular messaging apps) refuse to work unless the Contacts permission is granted.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS provides the Contact Scopes feature as an alternative to granting the Contacts permission.
                Enabling Contact Scopes makes the app assume that it has the Contacts permission, despite not actually 
                having it. By default, an app that has Contact Scopes enabled is not allowed any kind of contact access.</p>

                <p>Optionally, read access can be granted to the following scopes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Contact data (phone number or email). Access to each type of number and email in a contact is
                    granted separately. Access to the contact name is granted automatically.</li>
                    <li>Single contact. Access is granted to all contact data, except contact photo.</li>
                    <li>Contact group ("label"). Equivalent to granting access to all contacts in the group. Any contact
                    can be in any number of contact groups.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The type and name of the account that the contact is stored in are fully hidden from the app. The name
                of the contact account is usually the same as the email address of that account.</p>

                <p>When Contact Scopes is enabled, write access is fully blocked: the app is not allowed to edit any
                contact data, add or remove contacts, etc.</p>

            <section id="accessibility">
                <h2><a href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS includes all of the accessibility features from the Android Open
                Source Project and strives to fill in the gaps from not including Google apps and
                services. We include our own fork of the open source TalkBack accessibility
                service along with a Monochromacy option for the standard color correction
                menu.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS does not yet include a text-to-speech (TTS) service in the base OS
                due to limitations of the available options. Including one is planned in the
                future when a suitable option is available. RHVoice and eSpeak NG are both open
                source and are the most common choices by GrapheneOS users. Both of these work
                fine but have licensing issues. eSpeak NG has added Direct Boot based on our
                request for it, meaning it is able to function before the first unlock. RHVoice is
                missing Direct Boot and can't run before the first unlock. Installing and setting
                up either one of these or another TTS app will get TalkBack working. TalkBack
                itself supports Direct Boot and works before the first unlock but it needs to have
                a TTS app supporting it in order to do more than playing the activation sound
                before the first unlock. After installing a TTS service, you need to select it in
                the OS configuration to accept activating it. The OS will display one of them as
                already selected, but it won't simply work from being installed as that wouldn't
                be safe. This is the same as the stock OS but it comes with one set up
                already.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS disables showing the characters as passwords are typed by default. You
                can enable this in <b>Settings&#160;>
                Security &amp; privacy&#160;> Privacy&#160;> Show passwords</b>.</p>

                <p>Third party accessibility services can be installed and activated. This
                includes the ones made by Google. Most of these will work but some may have a hard
                dependency on functionality from Google Play services for some of their
                functionality or to run at all. Accessibility services are very powerful and we
                strongly recommend against using third party implementations if you can get by
                well without them. We plan to add safeguards in this area while still keeping them
                working without problematic barriers.</p>

                <h2><a href="#updates">Updates</a></h2>

                <p>The update system implements automatic background updates. It checks for updates
                approximately once every six hours when there's network connectivity and then
                downloads and installs updates in the background. It will pick up where it left off if
                downloads are interrupted, so you don't need to worry about interrupting it.
                Similarly, interrupting the installation isn't a risk because updates are installed to
                a secondary installation of GrapheneOS which only becomes the active installation
                after the update is complete. Once the update is complete, you'll be informed with a
                notification and simply need to reboot with the button in the notification or via a
                normal reboot. If the new version fails to boot, the OS will be rolled back to the
                past version and the updater will attempt to download and install the update
                again.</p>

                <p>The updater will use incremental (delta) updates to download only changes rather
                than the whole OS when one is available to go directly from the installed version to
                the latest version. As long as you have working network connectivity on a regular
                basis and reboot when asked, you'll almost always be on one of the past couple
                versions of the OS which will minimize bandwidth usage since incrementals will always
                be available.</p>

                <p>The updater works while the device is locked / idle, including before the first
                unlock since it's explicitly designed to be able to run before decryption of user
                data.</p>

                <p>Release changelogs are available <a href="/releases#changelog">in a section on the releases page</a>.</p>

                <section id="updates-settings">
                    <h3><a href="#updates-settings">Settings</a></h3>

                    <p>The settings are available in the Settings app in <b>System&#160;> System update</b>.</p>

                    <p>The "Check for updates" option will manually trigger an update check as soon as
                    possible. It will still wait for the configuration conditions listed below to be
                    satisfied, such as being connected to the internet via one of the permitted network
                    types.</p>

                    <p>The "Release channel" setting can be changed from the default Stable channel to the
                    Beta channel if you want to help with testing. The Beta channel will usually simply
                    follow the Stable channel, but the Beta channel may be used to experiment with new
                    features.</p>

                    <p>The "Permitted networks" setting controls which networks will be used to perform
                    updates. It defaults to using any network connection. It can be set to "Non-roaming"
                    to disable it when the cellular service is marked as roaming or "Unmetered" to disable
                    it on cellular networks and also Wi-Fi networks marked as metered.</p>

                    <p>The "Require battery above warning level" setting controls whether updates will
                    only be performed when the battery is above the level where the warning message is
                    shown. The standard value is at 15% capacity.</p>

                    <p>The "Require device to be charging" setting controls whether updates will
                    only be performed when the device is charging.</p>

                    <p>Enabling the opt-in "Automatic reboot" setting allows the updater to reboot the
                    device after an update once it has been idle for a long time. When this setting is
                    enabled, a device can take care of any number of updates completely automatically even
                    if it's left completely idle.</p>

                    <p>The "Notification settings" option is a shortcut to the System Updater notification
                    settings which allows you to control notification settings from System Updater such as
                    notification dot, lock screen, and noisy / silent notifications. These notifications
                    include updater errors, progress, already up to date, and reboot prompts. By default all
                    notifications are enabled.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#updates-security">Security</a></h3>

                    <p>The update server isn't a trusted party since updates are signed and verified along
                    with downgrade attacks being prevented. The update protocol doesn't send identifiable
                    information to the update server and works well over a VPN / Tor. GrapheneOS isn't
                    able to comply with a government order to build, sign and ship a malicious update to a
                    specific user's device based on information like the IMEI, serial number, etc. The
                    update server only ends up knowing the IP address used to connect to it and the
                    version being upgraded from based on the requested incremental.</p>

                    <p>Android updates can support serialno constraints to make them validate only on a
                    certain device but GrapheneOS rejects any update with a serialno constraint for both
                    over-the-air updates (Updater app) and sideloaded updates (recovery).</p>

                    <h3><a href="#updates-disabling">Disabling</a></h3>

                    <p>It's highly recommended to leave automatic updates enabled and to configure
                    the permitted networks if the bandwidth usage is a problem on your mobile data
                    connection. However, it's possible to turn off the update client by going to
                    <b>Settings&#160;> Apps</b>, enabling Show
                    system via the menu, selecting System Updater and disabling the app. If you do
                    this, you'll need to remember to enable it again to start receiving updates.</p>

                <section id="updates-sideloading">
                    <h3><a href="#updates-sideloading">Sideloading</a></h3>

                    <p>Updates can be downloaded via
                    <a href="/releases">the releases page</a> and installed via recovery
                    with adb sideloading. The zip files are signed and verified by recovery, just as they
                    are by the update client within the OS. This includes providing downgrade protection,
                    which prevents attempting to downgrade the version. If recovery didn't enforce these
                    things, they would still be enforced via verified boot including downgrade protection
                    and the attempted update would just fail to boot and be rolled back.</p>

                    <p>To install one by sideloading, first, boot into recovery. You may do this either by
                    using <code>adb reboot recovery</code> from the operating system, or by selecting the
                    "Recovery" option in the bootloader interface.</p>

                    <p>You should see the green Android lying on its back being repaired, with the text "No
                    command" meaning that no command has been passed to recovery.</p>

                    <p>Next, access the recovery menu by holding down the power button and pressing the volume
                    up button a single time. This key combination toggles between the GUI and text-based mode
                    with the menu and log output.</p>

                    <p>Finally, select the "Apply update from ADB" option in the recovery menu and
                    sideload the update with adb. For example:</p>

                    <pre>adb sideload raven-ota_update-2021122018.zip</pre>

                    <p><strong>You do not need to have adb enabled within the OS or the host's ADB key
                    whitelisted within the OS to sideload an update to recovery. Recovery mode does not
                    trust the attached computer and this can be considered a production feature. Trusting
                    a computer with ADB access within the OS is much different and exposes the device to a
                    huge amount of attack surface and control by the trusted computer.</strong></p>

                <p>Our <b>USB-C port and pogo pins</b> setting protects against attacks through
                USB-C or pogo pins while the OS is booted. For the majority of devices without pogo

                </ul>

                <p>The default is <b>Charging-only when locked</b>, which significantly reduces
                attack surface when the device is locked. After locking, it blocks any new USB

                <h2><a href="#web-browsing">Web browsing</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS includes our Vanadium subproject providing privacy and security
                enhanced releases of Chromium. Vanadium is both the user-facing browser included
                in the OS and the provider of the WebView used by other apps to render web
                content. The WebView is the browser engine used by nearly all other apps embedding
                web content or using web technologies for other uses. It's also used by many minor
                web browsers not forking Chromium as a whole. These apps using the WebView benefit
                from a subset of the Vanadium hardening.</p>

                <p>Vanadium was previously primarily focused on security hardening but we plan on
                adding assorted privacy and usability features. In the near future, we plan to add
                support for always incognito mode, improved state partitioning, backup/restore
                and many other features.</p>

                <p>Chromium-based browsers like Vanadium provide the strongest sandbox
                implementation, leagues ahead of the alternatives. It is much harder to escape
                from the sandbox and it provides much more than acting as a barrier to
                compromising the rest of the OS. Site isolation enforces security boundaries
                around each site using the sandbox by placing each site into an isolated sandbox.
                It required a huge overhaul of the browser since it has to enforce these rules on
                all the IPC APIs. Site isolation is important even without a compromise, due to
                side channels. Browsers without site isolation are very vulnerable to attacks like
                Spectre. On mobile, due to the lack of memory available to apps, there are
                different modes for site isolation. Vanadium turns on strict site isolation,
                matching Chromium on the desktop, along with strict origin isolation.</p>

                <p>Chromium has decent exploit mitigations, unlike the available alternatives.
                This is improved upon in Vanadium by enabling further mitigations, including those
                developed upstream but not yet fully enabled due to code size, memory usage or
                performance. For example, it enables type-based CFI like Chromium on the desktop,
                uses a stronger SSP configuration, zero initializes variables by default, etc.
                Some of the mitigations are inherited from the OS itself, which also applies to
                other browsers, at least if they don't do things to break them.</p>

                <p>We recommend against trying to achieve browser privacy and security through
                piling on browser extensions and modifications. Most privacy features for browsers
                are privacy theater without a clear threat model and these features often reduce
                privacy by aiding fingerprinting and adding more state shared between sites. Every
                change you make results in you standing out from the crowd and generally provides
                more ways to track you. Enumerating badness via content filtering is not a viable
                approach to achieving decent privacy, just as AntiVirus isn't a viable way to
                achieving decent security. These are losing battles, and are at best a stopgap
                reducing exposure while waiting for real privacy and security features.</p>

                <p>Vanadium will be following the school of thought where hiding the IP address
                through Tor or a trusted VPN shared between many users is the essential baseline,
                with the browser partitioning state based on site and mitigating fingerprinting to
                avoid that being trivially bypassed. The Tor Browser's approach is the only one
                with any real potential, however flawed the current implementation may be. This
                work is currently in a very early stage and it is largely being implemented
                upstream with the strongest available implementation of state partitioning.
                Chromium is using Network Isolation Keys to divide up connection pools, caches and
                other state based on site and this will be the foundation for privacy. Chromium
                itself aims to prevent tracking through mechanisms other than cookies, greatly
                narrowing the scope downstream work needs to cover. The focus is currently on
                research since we don't see much benefit in deploying bits and pieces of this
                before everything is ready to come together. At the moment, the only browser with
                any semblance of privacy is the Tor Browser but there are many ways to bypass the
                anti-fingerprinting and state partitioning. The Tor Browser's security is weak
                which makes the privacy protection weak. The need to avoid diversity
                (fingerprinting) creates a monoculture for the most interesting targets. This
                needs to change, especially since Tor itself makes people into much more of a
                target (both locally and by the exit nodes).</p>

                <p>WebView-based browsers use the hardened Vanadium rendering engine, but they can't
                offer as much privacy and control due to being limited to the capabilities supported
                by the WebView widget. For example, they can't provide a setting for toggling sensors
                access because the feature is fairly new and the WebView WebSettings API doesn't yet
                include support for it as it does for JavaScript, location, cookies, DOM storage and
                other older features. For sensors, the Sensors app permission added by GrapheneOS can
                be toggled off for the browser app as a whole instead. The WebView sandbox also
                currently runs every instance within the same sandbox and doesn't support site
                isolation.</p>

                <p>Avoid Gecko-based browsers like Firefox as they're currently much more vulnerable
                to exploitation and inherently add a huge amount of attack surface. Gecko doesn't have
                a WebView implementation (GeckoView is not a WebView implementation), so it has to be
                used alongside the Chromium-based WebView rather than instead of Chromium, which means
                having the remote attack surface of two separate browser engines instead of only one.
                Firefox / Gecko also bypass or cripple a fair bit of the upstream and GrapheneOS
                hardening work for apps. Worst of all, Firefox does not have internal sandboxing
                on Android. This is despite the fact that Chromium semantic sandbox layer on
                Android is implemented via the OS <code>isolatedProcess</code> feature, which is a
                very easy to use boolean property for app service processes to provide strong
                isolation with only the ability to communicate with the app running them via the
                standard service API. Even in the desktop version, Firefox's sandbox is still
                substantially weaker (especially on Linux) and lacks full support for isolating
                sites from each other rather than only containing content as a whole. The sandbox
                has been gradually improving on the desktop but it isn't happening for their
                Android browser yet.</p>

                <h2><a href="#camera">Camera</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS has the same camera capabilities and quality as the stock OS. It
                will match the stock OS when comparing the same app on each OS. GrapheneOS uses
                our own modern Camera app rather than the standard AOSP Camera app. GrapheneOS
                Camera is far better than any of the portable open source camera alternatives and
                even most proprietary camera apps including paid apps. On Pixels, Pixel Camera
                can be used as an alternative with more features. The section below has a detailed
                guide on using GrapheneOS Camera and the following section explains the remaining
                advantages of Pixel Camera on Pixels.</p>

                <section id="grapheneos-camera-app">
                    <h3><a href="#grapheneos-camera-app">GrapheneOS Camera app</a></h3>

                    <p>GrapheneOS includes our own modern camera app focused on privacy and
                    security. It includes modes for capturing images, videos and QR / barcode
                    scanning along with additional modes based on CameraX vendor extensions
                    (Portrait, HDR, Night, Face Retouch and Auto) on <a
                    href="https://developer.android.com/training/camera/supported-devices">devices
                    where they're available</a> (Pixels currently only have support for Night mode).</p>

                    <p>Modes are displayed as tabs at the bottom of the screen. You can switch
                    between modes using the tab interface or by swiping left/right anywhere on the
                    screen. The arrow button at the top of the screen opens the settings panel and
                    you can close it by pressing anywhere outside the settings panel. You can also
                    swipe down to open the settings and swipe up to close it. Outside of the QR
                    scanning mode, there's a row of large buttons above the tab bar for switching
                    between the cameras (left), capturing images and starting/stopping video
                    recording (middle) and opening the gallery (right). The volume keys can also
                    be used as an equivalent to pressing the capture button. While recording a
                    video, the gallery button becomes an image capture button for capturing
                    images.</p>

                    <p>Our Camera app provides the system media intents used by other apps to
                    capture images / record videos via the OS provided camera implementation.
                    These intents can only be provided by a system app since Android 11, so the
                    quality of the system camera is quite important.</p>

                    <p>The app has an in-app gallery and video player for images/videos taken with
                    it. It currently opens an external editor activity for the edit action.
                    GrapheneOS comes with AOSP Gallery which provides an editor activity. You can
                    install a nicer photo editor and the Camera app will be able to use it. We
                    plan to replace AOSP Gallery with a standalone variant of the gallery we're
                    developing for the Camera app in the future.</p>

                    <p>Using the default 4:3 aspect ratio for image capture is recommended since
                    16:9 is simply cropped output on all supported devices. A device oriented
                    towards video recording might actually have a wider image sensor but that's
                    not the case for Pixels or nearly any other smartphone.</p>

                    <p>Image capture uses lightweight HDR+ on all supported Pixels and HDRnet for the
                    preview on 5th generation Pixels. Using the torch or camera flash will result
                    in HDR+ being disabled which is why automatic flash isn't enabled by default.
                    The lightweight HDR+ doesn't use as many frames as the more aggressive Pixel
                    Camera HDR+. CameraX extensions will eventually provide support for an HDR
                    mode with more aggressive HDR+ taking/combining more than only around 3 frames.
                    It currently supports a Night mode providing the Night Sight variant of HDR+ inflating
                    the light of the scene through combining the frames. Other fancy features like
                    Portrait mode will also depend on CameraX extensions being provided in the
                    future. There isn't a timeline for when additional CameraX extensions will be added.</p>

                    <p>Zooming via pinch to zoom or the zoom slider will automatically make use of
                    the wide angle and telephoto cameras on Pixels. 5th and 6th generation Pixels
                    (4a (5G), 5, 5a, 6, 6 Pro) have a wide angle camera for zooming out to under
                    1x to capture a much wider field of view. Images taken with the wide angle
                    lens won't match the quality of the normal camera, especially with 6th
                    generation Pixels. Flagship 4th generation Pixels (4, 4 XL) have a telephoto
                    camera providing 2x optical zoom and the Pixel 6 Pro has one providing 4x
                    optical zoom.</p>

                    <p>By default, continuous auto focus, auto exposure and auto white balance are
                    used across the whole scene. Tapping to focus will switch to auto focus, auto
                    exposure and auto white balance based on that location. The focus timeout
                    setting determines the timeout before it switches back the default mode. The
                    exposure compensation slider on the left allows manually tuning exposure and
                    will automatically adjust shutter speed, aperture and ISO without disrupting
                    lightweight HDR+ support. Further configuration / tuning will be provided in
                    the future.</p>

                    <p>The QR scanning mode only scans within the scanning square marked on the
                    screen. The QR code should be aligned with the edges of the square but can
                    have any 90 degree orientation. Non-standard inverted QR codes are fully
                    supported. It's a very quick and high quality QR scanner able to easily scan
                    very high density QR codes from Pixels. Every 2 seconds, it will refresh auto
                    focus, auto exposure and auto white balance on the scanning square. It has
                    full support for zooming in and out. The torch can be toggled with the button
                    at the bottom center. The auto toggle at the bottom left can be used to toggle
                    scanning for all supported barcode types. Alternatively, you can select which
                    barcode types it should scan via the menu at the top. It only scans QR codes
                    by default since that provides quick and reliable scanning. Most other types
                    of barcodes can result in false positives. Each enabled type will slow down
                    the scanning and will make it more prone to false positives especially with
                    difficult to scan barcodes such as a dense QR code.</p>

                    <p>Camera permission is the only one that's required. Images and videos are
                    stored via the Media Store API so media/storage permissions aren't required.
                    The Microphone permission is needed for video recording by default but not
                    when including audio is disabled. Location permission is only needed if you
                    explicitly enabling location tagging.</p>

                    <p>By default, EXIF metadata is stripped for captured images and only includes
                    the orientation. Stripping metadata for videos is planned but not supported
                    yet. Orientation metadata isn't stripped since it's fully visible from how the
                    image is displayed so it doesn't count as hidden metadata and is needed for
                    proper display. You can toggle off stripping EXIF metadata in the More
                    Settings menu opened from the settings dialog. Disabling metadata stripping
                    will leave the timestamp, phone model, exposure configuration and other
                    metadata. Location tagging is disabled by default and won't be stripped if you
                    enable it.</p>

                    <p>Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) is enabled by default on devices
                    providing it via the Camera2 API and can be disabled using the video settings
                    dialog.</p>

                    <p>Zero Shutter Lag (ZSL) is available as an opt-in toggle in More Settings
                    and speeds up image capture for the Camera mode when flash is disabled.</p>

                    <p>Pixel Camera (previously known as Google Camera) can take full advantage of the
                    available cameras and image processing hardware as it can on the stock OS and does
                    not require GSF or sandboxed Google Play on GrapheneOS. Direct TPU and GXP access
                    by Google apps including Pixel Camera is controlled by a toggle added by GrapheneOS
                    and doesn't provide them with any additional access to data. The toggle exists for
                    attack surface reduction. Every app can use the TPU and GXP via standard APIs
                    including the Android Neural Networks API and Camera2 API regardless.</p>

                    <p>We aim to reduce the benefits of Pixel Camera compared to GrapheneOS
                    Camera over time, especially on Pixels. Many features of Pixel Camera will
                    end up being available for GrapheneOS Camera in the next year or so via
                    CameraX extensions including more aggressive HDR+, Night Sight and Portrait.
                    Video features such as slow motion and time lapse are likely further away than
                    within the next year. These video features could potentially be provided via
                    CameraX vendor extensions or could be implemented via our own post-processing
                    of the video output. Panorama, Photo Sphere, Astrophotography, Motion Photos,
                    Frequent Faces, Dual Exposure Controls, Google Lens, etc. aren't on the
                    roadmap for GrapheneOS Camera. Video frame rate configuration and H.265
                    support should be available for GrapheneOS Camera in the near future via
                    CameraX improvements along with DNG (RAW) support in the further future.</p>

                <h2><a href="#exec-spawning">Exec spawning</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS creates fresh processes (via exec) when spawning applications instead of
                using the traditional Zygote spawning model. This improves privacy and security at the
                expense of higher cold start app spawning time and higher initial memory usage. It
                doesn't impact runtime performance beyond the initial spawning time. It adds somewhere
                in the ballpark of 200ms to app spawning time on the flagship devices and is only very
                noticeable on lower-end devices with a weaker CPU and slower storage. The spawning
                time impact only applies when the app doesn't already have an app process and the OS
                will try to keep app processes cached in the background until memory pressure forces
                it to start killing them.</p>

                <p>In the typical Zygote model, a template app process is created during boot and
                every app is spawned as a clone of it. This results in every app sharing the same
                initial memory content and layout, including sharing secrets that are meant to be
                randomized for each process. It saves time by reusing the initialization work. The
                initial memory usage is reduced due to copy-on-write semantics resulting in memory
                written only during initialization being shared between app processes.</p>

                <p>The Zygote model weakens the security provided by features based on random secrets
                including Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), stack canaries, heap canaries,
                randomized heap layout and memory tags. It cripples these security features since
                every app has the values for every other app and the values don't change for fresh app
                processes until reboot. Much of the OS itself is implemented via non-user-facing apps
                with privileges reserved for OS components. The Zygote template is reused across user
                profiles, so it also provides a temporary set of device identifiers across profiles
                for each boot via the shared randomized values.</p>

                memory usage instead of the substantial security benefits and the removal of the
                only known remaining direct device identifiers across profiles (i.e. not depending
                on fingerprinting global configuration, available storage space, etc. or using side
                channels).</p>

                <h2><a href="#bugs-uncovered-by-security-features">Bugs uncovered by security features</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS substantially expands the standard mitigations for memory corruption
                vulnerabilities. Some of these features are designed to directly catch the memory
                corruption bugs either via an explicit check or memory protection and abort the
                program in order to prevent them from being exploited. Other features mitigate issues
                a bit less directly such as zeroing data immediately upon free, isolated memory
                regions, heap randomization, etc. and can also lead to latent memory corruption bugs
                crashing instead of the program continuing onwards with corrupted memory. This means
                that many latent memory corruption bugs in apps are caught along with some in the OS
                itself. These bugs are not caused by GrapheneOS, but rather already existed and are
                uncovered by the features. The features are aimed at preventing or hindering exploits,
                not finding bugs, but they do that as part of doing their actual job.</p>

                <p>Similarly, some of the other privacy and security improvements reduce the access
                available to applications and they may crash. Some of these features are always
                enabled under the hood, while others like the Network and Sensors toggles are
                controlled by users via opt-in or opt-out toggles. Apps may not handle having access
                taken away like this, although it generally doesn't cause any issues as it's all
                designed to be friendly to apps and fully compatible rather than killing the

                <h2><a href="#wifi-privacy">Wi-Fi privacy</a></h2>

                <p>Wi-Fi on GrapheneOS is very privacy-friendly and is essentially anonymous as long
                as apps do not leak uniquely identifying information to the network. GrapheneOS avoids
                allowing itself to be fingerprinted as GrapheneOS, other than connections which are
                documented (see the <a href="/faq#default-connections">default connections FAQ</a>)
                and can be easily disabled or forced through a VPN service.</p>

                <section id="wifi-privacy-scanning">
                    <h3><a href="#wifi-privacy-scanning">Scanning</a></h3>

                    <p>MAC randomization is always performed for Wi-Fi scanning. Pixel
                    phones have firmware support for scanning MAC randomization going
                    <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html">significantly beyond a naive implementation</a>.
                    On many other devices, there are identifiers exposed by Wi-Fi scanning beyond the MAC
                    address such as the packet sequence number and assorted identifying information in the
                    probe requests.</p>

                    <p>Avoid using hidden APs (i.e. APs not broadcasting their SSID) since all
                    known hidden SSIDs end up being broadcast as part of scanning for networks to
                    find them again. SSIDs are not broadcast for standard non-hidden APs. Hidden
                    APs are only hidden when no devices are connected. It makes little sense as a
                    privacy feature, especially for a non-mobile AP where knowing the AP exists
                    can't be used for tracking it since it doesn't move. The feature reduces your
                    privacy rather than increasing it. If you need to use a hidden AP, make sure
                    to delete the saved network afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning for improving location detection are disabled by
                    default, unlike the stock OS. These can be toggled in <b>Settings&#160;> Location&#160;>
                    Location services&#160;> Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
                    scanning</b>. These features enable scanning even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is
                    disabled, so these need to be kept disabled to fully disable the radios when
                    Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled. GrapheneOS itself doesn't currently include a
                    supplementary location service based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning. These
                    options impact whether apps such as sandboxed Google Play are able to use the
                    functionality if you grant them the Location permission. GrapheneOS plans to
                    eventually include an OS service based on local databases rather than a
                    network-based service giving the user's location to a server whenever location
                    is being used.</p>

                    <p>Associated MAC randomization is performed by default. This can be controlled
                    per-network in <b>Settings&#160;> Network
                    &amp; internet&#160;> Internet&#160;> <var>NETWORK</var>&#160;> Privacy</b>.</p>

                    <p>In the stock OS, the default is to use a unique persistent random MAC address for
                    each network. It has 2 options available: "Use randomized MAC (default)" and "Use
                    device MAC". In GrapheneOS, the default is generating a new random MAC address when
                    connecting to a network. It has 3 options available: "Use per-connection randomized MAC
                    (default)", "Use per-network randomized MAC" and "Use device MAC".</p>

                    <p>In rare cases, broken routers are unable to accept new clients once their
                    DHCP table is full instead of clearing the last recently used entry. You can
                    work around this by manually clearing the DHCP table via the router
                    administration page and can switch to the per-network randomized MAC mode to
                    avoid triggering the issue again. This would prevent a router being used in
                    any situation where many clients naturally come and go even without
                    per-connection MAC randomization and is not generally an issue for any modern
                    routers. Per-connection MAC randomization only makes it more likely to find a
                    one of the rare routers with this issue.</p>

                    <p>The DHCP client uses the anonymity profile rather than sending a hostname
                    so it doesn't compromise the privacy offered by MAC randomization. When the
                    per-connection MAC randomization added by GrapheneOS is being used, DHCP
                    client state is flushed before reconnecting to a network to avoid revealing
                    that it's likely the same device as before.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also disables support for stable link-local IPv6 addresses, since these
                    have the potential to be used as identifiers. It's more sensible to use typical
                    link-local address generation based on the (randomized) MAC address since link-local
                    devices have access to both. As of Android 11, Android only uses stable link-local
                    privacy addresses when MAC randomization is disabled, so we no longer need to disable
                    the feature.</p>

                <p>If you have a reliable LTE connection from your carrier, you can reduce attack
                surface by disabling 2G, 3G and 5G connectivity in <b>Settings&#160;> Network &amp; internet&#160;>
                SIMs&#160;> <var>SIM</var>&#160;> Preferred network type</b>. Traditional voice calls will only
                work in the LTE-only mode if you have either an LTE connection and VoLTE (Voice over LTE) support or
                a Wi-Fi connection and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi) support. VoLTE / VoWi-Fi works on GrapheneOS for
                most carriers unless they restrict it to carrier phones. Some carriers may be missing VoWi-Fi due to
                us not including their proprietary apps. Please note that AT&amp;T users may see "5Ge" being used
                when LTE Only mode is enabled as AT&amp;T intentionally mislabel LTE services as "5Ge" to mislead
                users.</p>

                <p>This feature is not intended to improve the confidentiality of traditional calls and
                texts, but it might somewhat raise the bar for some forms of interception. It's not a
                substitute for end-to-end encrypted calls / texts or even transport layer encryption.
                LTE does provide basic network authentication / encryption, but it's for the network
                itself. The intention of the LTE-only feature is only hardening against remote
                exploitation by disabling an enormous amount of both legacy code (2G, 3G) and bleeding
                edge code (5G).</p>

                <!-- keep in sync with features.html since we aren't simply linking to
                    features.html to avoid people skipping this important explanation -->

                <p>GrapheneOS has a compatibility layer providing the option to install and use
                the official releases of Google Play in the standard app sandbox. Google Play
                receives absolutely no special access or privileges on GrapheneOS as opposed to
                bypassing the app sandbox and receiving a massive amount of highly privileged
                access. Instead, the compatibility layer teaches it how to work within the full
                app sandbox. It also isn't used as a backend for the OS services as it would be
                elsewhere since GrapheneOS doesn't use Google Play even when it's installed.</p>

                <p>Since the Google Play apps are simply regular apps on GrapheneOS, you install
                them within a specific user or work profile and they're only available within that
                profile. Only apps within the same profile can use it and they need to explicitly
                choose to use it. It works the same way as any other app and has no special
                capabilities. As with any other app, it can't access data of other apps and
                requires explicit user consent to gain access to profile data or the standard
                permissions. Apps within the same profile can communicate with mutual consent and
                it's no different for sandboxed Google Play.</p>

                <p>Sandboxed Google Play is close to being fully functional and provides near
                complete compatibility with the app ecosystem depending on Google Play. Only a
                small subset of privileged functionality which we haven't yet ported to different
                approaches with our compatibility layer is unavailable. Some functionality is
                inherently privileged and can't be provided as part of the compatibility
                layer.</p>

                <p>The vast majority of Play services functionality works perfectly including
                dynamically downloaded / updated modules (dynamite modules) and functionality
                provided by modular app components such as Google Play Games. By default, location
                requests are rerouted to a reimplementation of the Play geolocation service
                provided by GrapheneOS. You can disable rerouting and use the standard Play
                services geolocation service instead if you want the Google network location
                service and related features. This shouldn't be needed outside of testing or
                obscure use cases, since GrapheneOS provides its own opt-in
                <a href="/features#network-location">Network Location</a> feature.</p>

                <p>Our compatibility layer includes full support for the Play Store. Play Store
                services are fully available including in-app purchases, Play Asset Delivery, Play
                Feature Delivery and app / content license checks. It can install, update and
                uninstall apps with the standard approach requiring that the user authorizes it as
                an app source and consents to each action. It will use the standard Android 12+
                unattended update feature to do automatic updates for apps where it was the last
                installer.</p>

                <section id="sandboxed-google-play-installation">
                    <h3><a href="#sandboxed-google-play-installation">Installation</a></h3>

                    <p>The simplest approach is to only use the Owner user profile. Apps installed
                    in the Owner profile are sandboxed the same way as everywhere else and don't
                    receive any special access. If you want to choose which apps use Google Play
                    rather than making it available to all of them, install it in a separate user
                    or work profile for apps depending on Google Play. You could also do it the
                    other way around, but it makes more sense to try to use as much as possible
                    without Google Play rather than treating not using it as the exceptional
                    case.</p>

                    <p>To install sandboxed Google Play, open our App Store, select Google Play
                    services and install it. This will install both Google Play services and Google
                    Play Store which are interdependent. Existing installs of sandboxed Google Play
                    from before Android 15 will also have Google Services Framework installed and it
                    shouldn't be removed.</p>

                    <p>Google Play services and Google Play Store are updated through the App Store.
                    </p>

                    <p>You should give a battery optimization exception to Google Play services
                    for features like push notifications to work properly in the background. It
                    isn't needed for the Google Play Store app.</p>

                    <p>Signing in into a Google account is optional, unless you want to
                    use features depending on being signed into an account. For example, some apps
                    use Google account authentication instead of their accounts having a username
                    and password. The Play Store requires being signed into an account in order to
                    install apps or use in-app purchases. This is still true even for an alternate
                    frontend to the Play Store. Aurora Store still requires an account but fetches
                    shared account credentials from Aurora Store's service by default.</p>

                    <p>The Play Store provides many services used by apps including Play Asset
                    Delivery, Play Feature Delivery, in-app purchases and license checks for paid
                    apps. The Play Store app is also the most secure way to install and update apps
                    from the Play Store.</p>

                    <p>Our compatibility layer has support for Play Games Services which you can
                    obtain by installing Google Play Games from the Play Store. Many games on the
                    Play Store depend on having Google Play Games installed.</p>

                    <p>By default, apps using Google Play geolocation are redirected to our own
                    implementation on top of the standard OS geolocation service. You don't need to
                    grant any permissions to Google Play or change any settings for working location
                    in apps using Google Play geolocation due to our rerouting feature.</p>

                    <p>This is not recommended unless you're testing something or have an obscure
                    use case since our <a href="/features#network-location">network location</a>
                    feature can be used instead, but if you want to use Google's network location
                    service to provide location estimates without satellite reception, you can
                    follow these steps:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Disable the "Reroute location requests to OS APIs" toggle.</li>
                        <li>Grant "Allow all the time" Location access to Google Play services along with the
                        Nearby Devices permission for it to have all the access it needs. </li>
                        <li>Use the "Google Location Accuracy" link from the sandboxed Google Play configuration
                        menu to access the Google Play services menu for opting into their network location service.</li>
                        <li>To take advantage of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, you also need to enable the scanning
                        toggles in <b>Settings&#160;>
                        Location &#160;> Location services</b>
                        which are disabled by default and control whether apps with the required permissions
                        can scan when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are otherwise disabled.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Re-routing location to the OS geolocation service will use more power than
                    using the Google Play geolocation service unless you enable our opt-in
                    <a href="/features#network-location">network location</a> feature.</p>

                    <p>The Google Location Accuracy and Google settings activities would normally
                    be integrated into the OS but we don't include any of the standard Google Play
                    integration so there needs to be an app providing a way to access them.</p>

                    <p>Location sharing in Google Maps is implemented in Google Play services. It
                    requires enabling both the Location permission with "Allow all the time" and the
                    Physical activity permission for Google Play services. Our location rerouting
                    feature reimplementing the Google Play location service using the OS location
                    service does not apply to Google Play services itself, so Google Play services
                    won't use the OS network location service. You can use the instructions above
                    for enabling network location via Google Play if you want this. You could
                    continue using rerouting for other apps or disable it to avoid needing 2
                    separate network location services enabled.</p>

                    <p>Our compatibility layer has to be expanded on a case-by-case basis to teach
                    Play services to work as a regular app without any of the invasive access and
                    integration it expects. In many cases, it doesn't truly need the access or we
                    can teach it to use the regular approach available to a normal app. In some
                    cases, the functionality it offers fundamentally requires privileged access
                    and cannot be supported. For example, Android Auto cannot be supported by
                    default as part of the baseline compatibility layer, but is supported as an
                    extension of it with dedicated toggles for the functionality that's not
                    possible to implement another way. The same applies to other highly invasive
                    OS integration / control or privileged access to hardware. Our compatibility
                    layer is a very actively developed work in progress and most of the remaining
                    unavailable functionality is quickly becoming supported. In the future, we can
                    also support redirection for more APIs such as FIDO2 rather than only the
                    geolocation service.</p>

                    <p>Functionality depending on the OS integrating Play services and using it as
                    a backend is unavailable. An OS integrating Play uses it as the backend for OS
                    services such as geolocation. GrapheneOS never uses it as the backend/provider
                    for OS services. In cases such as text-to-speech (TTS) where the OS allows the
                    user to choose the provider, Play services can often be used. It's on a level
                    playing field with other apps on GrapheneOS.</p>

                <h3><a href="#esim-management">eSIM management</a></h3>
                <p>By default, GrapheneOS has always shipped with baseline support for eSIM,
                where users can use any eSIMs installed previously on the device. However, in
                order to manage and add eSIMs, proprietary Google functionality is needed. This
                is fully disabled by default.</p>

                <p>Even though proprietary functionality is needed, eSIM management on GrapheneOS 
                doesn't require any dependency on Google Play, and it never shares data to Google 
                Play even when installed. It won't connect to a Google service unless the carrier 
                uses one themselves.</p>

                <p>eSIM management can be enabled in <b>Settings&#160;>
                Network &amp; internet&#160;>
                eSIM support</b>. The toggle is persistent across every boot.</p>

                <p>Note that if the eSIM installation process does not progress past the
                "Checking network info..." stage despite having a stable Internet connection,
                you may need to call the USSD code <code>*#*#4636#*#*</code> and then enable
                DSDS in the menu that is presented.</p>

                <p>If an eSIM locked with a PIN is used, it is recommended to leave the eSIM
                support toggle enabled even after activating the eSIM. This will allow you to
                disable the eSIM on the lockscreen in case the PIN is forgotten. If the eSIM
                support toggle is disabled and the PIN is forgotten, there is no way to access the
                device unless the PUK is provided.</p>

                <h2><a href="#android-auto">Android Auto</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS provides an option to install and use the official releases of
                Android Auto.</p>

                <p>Android Auto requires privileged access in order to work. GrapheneOS uses
                an extension of the sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer to make Android
                Auto work with a reduced level of privileges.</p>

                <p>To install Android Auto, use the GrapheneOS App Store. Android Auto
                can't be installed through the Play Store or other app sources. Android Auto
                depends on sandboxed Google Play, you'll be prompted to install it if it's not
                already installed.</p>

                <p>After installation, Android Auto has to be set up from the <b>Settings&#160;> Apps&#160;>
                Sandboxed Google Play&#160;> Android Auto</b>
                configuration screen, which contains permission toggles, links to related
                configuration screens, configuration tips, and links to optional Android Auto
                dependencies. To set up Android Auto in Private Space, install Sandboxed Google 
                Play and Android Auto there, then go to <b>Settings&#160;> Security and privacy&#160;> Private 
                Space&#160;> Sandboxed Google Play</b>.</p>

                <p>The permission toggles ask for a confirmation before turning on. The
                confirmation popup explains what access each permission toggle provides.</p>

                <p>By default, Android Auto is not granted any kind of privileged access. It's
                treated the same way other apps are treated.</p>

                <p>In order to work, Android Auto has to be granted baseline permissions for wired
                or wireless Android Auto. Wired Android Auto requires far less access than wireless
                Android Auto does. Baseline permissions are controlled by the "Allow permissions
                for wired / wireless Android Auto" toggles.</p>

                <p>For some cars, baseline permissions for wireless Android Auto are needed even
                when using wired Android Auto. Therefore, if wired Android Auto is unable to
                connect to the car with only wired permissions granted, try granting wireless
                permissions instead.</p>

                <p>To forward notifications from the device to the car, Android Auto has to be
                allowed notification access. The notification access settings are linked below the
                permission toggles.</p>

                <p>In order to show up in the Android Auto car interface, apps have to be installed
                from the Play Store and include Android Auto support.</p>

                <h2><a href="#banking-apps">Banking apps</a></h2>

                <p>Banking apps are a particularly problematic class of apps for compatibility
                with alternate operating systems. Some of these work fine with any GrapheneOS
                configuration but most of them have extensive dependencies on Play services. For
                many of these apps, it's enough to set up the GrapheneOS sandboxed Google Play
                feature in the same profile. Unfortunately, there are further complications not
                generally encountered with non-financial apps.</p>

                <p>Many of these apps have their own crude anti-tampering mechanisms trying to
                prevent inspecting or modifying the app in a weak attempt to hide their code and API
                from security researchers. GrapheneOS allows users to disable <b>Native code
                debugging</b> via a toggle in <b>Settings&#160;>
                Security &amp; privacy&#160;> Exploit protection</b>
                to improve the app sandbox and this can interfere with apps debugging their
                own code to add a barrier to analyzing the app. You should try enabling this again if you've
                disabled it and are encountering compatibility issues with these kinds of apps.</p>

                <p>Banking apps are increasingly using Google's SafetyNet attestation service to
                check the integrity and certification status of the operating system. GrapheneOS
                passes the <code>basicIntegrity</code> check but isn't certified by Google so it
                fails the <code>ctsProfileMatch</code> check. Most apps currently only enforce
                weak software-based attestation which can be bypassed by spoofing what it checks.
                GrapheneOS doesn't attempt to bypass the checks since it would be very fragile and
                would repeatedly break as the checks are improved. Devices launched with Android 8
                or later have hardware attestation support which cannot be bypassed without leaked
                keys or serious vulnerabilities so the era of being able to bypass these checks by
                spoofing results is coming to an end regardless.</p>

                <p>The hardware attestation feature is part of the Android Open Source Project and
                is fully supported by GrapheneOS. SafetyNet attestation chooses to use it to
                enforce using Google certified operating systems. However, app developers can use
                it directly and permit other properly signed operating systems upholding the
                security model. GrapheneOS has a
                <a href="/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide">detailed guide</a> for app
                developers on how to support GrapheneOS with the hardware attestation API. Direct
                use of the hardware attestation API provides much higher assurance than using
                SafetyNet so these apps have nothing to lose by using a more meaningful API and
                supporting a more secure OS.</p>

            <section id="app-link-verification">
                <h2><a href="#app-link-verification">App link verification</a></h2>

                <p>Android apps can declare associations with domains in order to handle those URLs
                in the app automatically. For security reasons, app links are disabled by default to
                prevent apps intercepting arbitrary URLs. First party apps associated with a domain
                are expected to be authorized by the domain. Apps can ask for their app links to be
                verified by the OS by marking them with <code>autoVerify</code> in their manifest.
                The OS will securely confirm that the domain authorizes the app to handle the
                domain's URLs. Users can also manually enable an app's link associations via
                <b>Settings&#160;> Apps&#160;> <var>APP</var>&#160;>
                Open by default&#160;> Add link</b>. Apps can ask
                users to enable the associations and send them to this page in the Settings app.</p>

                <p>As an example, the first party YouTube app will have the app links verified by
                the OS automatically while the NewPipe app requires manually enabling handling
                links for YouTube and other sites.</p>

                <p>Verification of app links by the OS is done by the Intent Filter Verification
                Service system app. It will use an HTTPS GET request to fetch
                <code>https://example.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json</code> in order to process a
                request to verify that an app can handle <code>example.com</code> links. The app
                needs to have their app id and signing keys authorized by the domain in order for
                the verification to succeed.</p>

                <p>These network requests by the Intent Filter Verification Service to verify app
                associations with domains are commonly confused for network requests made by the
                apps. It's simply an HTTPS GET request without identifying information and doesn't
                offer a communication channel with the app. Redirects won't be followed so there
                will be a single request for each attempt to verify a domain.</p>

                <p>If you don't want automatic app link verification, you can disable the Network
                permission added by GrapheneOS for the Intent Filter Verification Service system
                app. In the future, we may provide a way to disable verification directly instead
                of stopping it from working. It will make heavily throttled attempts to verify a
                domain after the check failed which won't negatively impact battery life due to
                the conservative JobScheduler-based implementation.</p>

                <h2><a href="#carrier-functionality">Carrier functionality</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS aims to work with all carriers that are officially supported by
                Google on the stock operating system on Pixel devices. Wi-Fi Calling, VoLTE,
                Visual Voicemail, MMS, SMS, Calling and 5G (SA and NSA) all are supported, however
                some functionality may not be usable due to Google not supporting carriers on the
                stock OS officially or due to GrapheneOS not shipping proprietary apps required in
                order for this functionality to work on some carriers. GrapheneOS extracts
                CarrierConfigs, APNs, modem configurations, Visual Voicemail configurations and
                MMS configurations from the stock operating system to ensure users get easy
                carrier support that "just works".</p>

                <p>Please note that in some regions, LTE is referred to as 4G.</p>

                <p>Generally 5G, SMS, MMS, Calls and VoLTE will work fine on GrapheneOS with
                officially supported carriers by Google. Wi-Fi calling may vary due to a reliance
                on proprietary Google apps which GrapheneOS does not ship.</p>

                <p>If you are having issues with Visual Voicemail, please be aware that AT&amp;T
                USA users are unable to use this feature currently due to a lack of AOSP support.
                Other carriers are done on a best effort basis. We would suggest using <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer">Google
                Dialer</a> with sandboxed Google Play if you are unable to get this feature
                working.</p>

                <p>If you are having problems sending or receiving SMS/MMS messages, we suggest
                that you perform the following steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Deregister your phone number from <a href="https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/">Apple iMessage</a></li>

                    <li>Deregister your phone number from your carrier's RCS service (Not all carriers have this)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you continue to have problems despite following the instructions above or
                you have another carrier related issue, we suggest that you perform the following
                steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Some carriers require you to explicitly opt in to use services such as Wi-Fi calling.
                        Consult your carrier's documentation on the process for this or contact them.</li>
                    <li><b>Reset Mobile Network Settings</b> in <b>Settings&#160;> System&#160;>
                        Reset options</b> and then reboot the device.</li>
                    <li>USA users only: You may need to request your carrier to enable CDMA-less mode if
                        you have issues.</li>
                    <li>Follow your carrier's instructions for setting up APNs, this can be found in
                        <b>Settings&#160;> Network &amp;
                        internet&#160;> SIMs&#160;> <var>SIM</var>&#160;> Access Point Names</b></li>
                    <li>If calls do not work and you have <a href="#lte-only-mode">LTE-only mode</a> enabled,
                        try toggling it off. If "Allow 2G" is disabled, try toggling it back on. Your carrier
                        may not properly support VoLTE.</li>
                    <li>As a last resort you may need to ask your carrier for a replacement SIM card.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some carriers may restrict functionality, such as VoLTE, on imported Pixel
                devices as they only whitelist the IMEI ranges of Pixel device SKUs which were sold
                locally. You can check your SKU on GrapheneOS by going to <b>Settings&#160;> About phone&#160;>
                Model&#160;> Hardware SKU</b> and using the <a
                href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570">official Google
                documentation</a>. You should check if such functionality works on the stock OS to troubleshoot.
                It is not possible to change the IMEI on a production device and GrapheneOS cannot add support for
                it since the hardware doesn't support it.</p>

                <p>Android 12 introduced support for the
                <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//TS.43-v11.0-Service-Entitlement-Configuration.pdf">GSMA
                TS.43</a> standard where provisioning for VoLTE, VoNR and Wi-Fi calling may be
                handled by Google Firebase. Currently it is very rare for carriers to be using
                Firebase to handle this. It is unlikely, but technically possible, that with such
                carriers you may be required to install sandboxed Google Play in order to obtain
                the former mentioned functionality where the carrier has not implemented fallback
                provisioning via SMS. Currently only US Cellular, Orange France, Cspire US,
                and Cellcom US are using this standard.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS includes bypasses for carrier restrictions on APN editing, tethering
                via USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and the ability to disable 2G (only on 6th
                generation Pixel devices onwards) actions which would not necessarily have been
                possible on the stock operating system.</p>
