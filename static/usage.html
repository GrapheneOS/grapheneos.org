                <a href="#updates">Updates</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The update system implements automatic background updates. It checks for updates
            approximately once every four hours when there's network connectivity and then
            downloads and installs updates in the background. It will pick up where it left off if
            downloads are interrupted, so you don't need to worry about interrupting it.
            Similarly, interrupting the installation isn't a risk because updates are installed to
            a secondary installation of GrapheneOS which only becomes the active installation
            after the update is complete. Once the update is complete, you'll be informed with a
            notification and simply need to reboot with the button in the notification or via a
            normal reboot. If the new version fails to boot, the OS will be rolled back to the
            past version and the updater will attempt to download and install the update
            again.</p>

            <p>The updater will use incremental (delta) updates to download only changes rather
            than the whole OS when one is available to go directly from the installed version to
            the latest version. As long as you have working network connectivity on a regular
            basis and reboot when asked, you'll almost always be on one of the past couple
            versions of the OS which will minimize bandwidth usage since incrementals will always
            be available.</p>

            <p>The updater works while the device is locked / idle, including before the first
            unlock since it's explicitly designed to be able to run before decryption of user
            data.</p>

            <p>Release changelogs are available <a href="/releases#changelog">in a section on the releases page</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-settings">
                <a href="#updates-settings">Settings</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The settings are available in the Settings app in System ➔ Advanced ➔ Update
            settings.</p>

            <p>The "Release channel" setting can be changed from the default Stable channel to the
            Beta channel if you want to help with testing. The Beta channel will usually simply
            follow the Stable channel, but the Beta channel may be used to experiment with new
            features.</p>

            <p>The "Permitted networks" setting controls which networks will be used to perform
            updates. It defaults to using any network connection. It can be set to "Non-roaming"
            to disable it when the cellular service is marked as roaming or "Unmetered" to disable
            it on cellular networks and also Wi-Fi networks marked as metered.</p>

            <p>The "Require battery above warning level" setting controls whether updates will
            only be performed when the battery is above the level where the warning message is
            shown. The standard value is at 15% capacity.</p>

            <p>Enabling the opt-in "Automatic reboot" setting allows the updater to reboot the
            device after an update once it has been idle for a long time. When this setting is
            enabled, a device can take care of any number of updates completely automatically even
            if it's left completely idle.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-security">
                <a href="#updates-security">Security</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The update server isn't a trusted party since updates are signed and verified along
            with downgrade attacks being prevented. The update protocol doesn't send identifiable
            information to the update server and works well over a VPN / Tor. GrapheneOS isn't
            able to comply with a government order to build, sign and ship a malicious update to a
            specific user's device based on information like the IMEI, serial number, etc. The
            update server only ends up knowing the IP address used to connect to it and the
            version being upgraded from based on the requested incremental.</p>

            <p>Android updates can support serialno constraints to make them validate only on a
            certain device but GrapheneOS rejects any update with a serialno constraint for both
            the Stable and Beta channels.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-disabling">
                <a href="#updates-disabling">Disabling</a>
            </h3>

            <p>It's highly recommended to leave automatic updates enabled and to configure the
            permitted networks if the bandwidth usage is a problem on your mobile data connection.
            However, it's possible to turn off the update client by going to Settings ➔ Apps,
            enabling Show system via the menu, selecting Seamless Update Client and disabling the
            app.  If you do this, you'll need to remember to enable it again to start receiving
            updates.</p>

            <h2 id="default-connections">
                <a href="#default-connections">Default connections</a>
            </h2>

            <p>GrapheneOS makes connections to the outside world to test connectivity, detect
            captive portals and download updates. No data varying per user / installation is sent
            in these connections. There aren't analytics / telemetry in GrapheneOS.</p>

            <p>The expected default connections by GrapheneOS (including all base system apps) are the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The GrapheneOS Updater app fetches update metadata from
                    https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-CHANNEL approximately once every four hours
                    when connected to a permitted network for updates.</p>
                    <p>Users can control which types of connections the Updater app will use, and
                    although it's strongly recommended to always leave it enabled it can be
                    disabled.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>On devices with a Qualcomm baseband (which provides GPS), when location
                    functionality is being used,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals#Almanac">GPS almanacs</a>
                    are downloaded from https://xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin,
                    https://xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin or
                    https://xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin. GrapheneOS has modified all
                    references to these servers to use HTTPS rather than a mix of HTTP and HTTPS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Connectivity checks designed to mimic a web browser user agent are performed
                    by using HTTP and HTTPS to fetch standard URLs generating an HTTP 204 status
                    code. This is used to detect when internet connectivity is lost on a network,
                    which triggers fallback to other available networks if possible. These checks
                    are designed to detect and handle captive portals which substitute the
                    expected empty 204 response with their own web page. These need use a very
                    common domain and URL in order to bypass whitelisting systems only permitting
                    access to common domains / URLs so a domain like grapheneos.org would likely
                    be inadequate. GrapheneOS leaves these set to the standard four URLs to blend
                    into the crowd of billions of other Android devices with and without Google
                    Mobile Services performing the same empty GET requests. For privacy reasons,
                    it isn't desirable to stand out from the crowd and changing these URLs or even
                    disabling the feature will likely reduce your privacy by giving your device a
                    more unique fingerprint. GrapheneOS aims to appear like any other common
                    mobile device on the network.</p>

            <h2 id="web-browsing">
                <a href="#web-browsing">Web browsing</a>
            </h2>

            <p>GrapheneOS includes a Vanadium subproject providing privacy and security enhanced
            releases of Chromium. Vanadium is both the user-facing browser included in the OS and
            the provider of the WebView used by other apps to render web content. The WebView is
            the browser engine used by the vast majority of web browsers and nearly all other apps
            embedding web content or using web technologies for other uses.</p>

            <p>Using Vanadium is highly recommended and Bromite is a good alternative if you want
            a few more features like ad-blocking and more aggressive anti-fingerprinting. Vanadium
            is working towards including these features and is actively collaborating with
            Bromite. Other Chromium-based browsers like Brave can also be decent choices.
            Standalone browsers based on Chromium have by far the best sandbox implementation.
            Site isolation can also be enabled, which makes the sandbox enforce a security
            boundary containing each site rather than isolating content as a whole. Vanadium
            enables site isolation by default, and Bromite enables it on high memory devices,
            including all officially supported GrapheneOS devices. Site isolation prevents an
            attacker from obtaining cookies (like login sessions) and other data tied to other
            sites if they successfully exploit the browser's rendering engine. It also provides
            the strongest available mitigation for Spectre-based side channel attacks.</p>

            <p>WebView-based browsers use the hardened Vanadium rendering engine, but they can't
            offer as much privacy and control due to being limited to the capabilities supported
            by the WebView widget. For example, they can't provide a setting for toggling sensors
            access because the feature is fairly new and the WebView WebSettings API doesn't yet
            include support for it as it does for JavaScript, location, cookies, DOM storage and
            other older features. For sensors, the Sensors app permission added by GrapheneOS can
            be toggled off for the browser app as a whole instead. The WebView sandbox also
            currently runs every instance within the same process and doesn't support site
            isolation.</p>

            <p>Avoid Gecko-based browsers like Firefox as they're currently much more vulnerable
            to exploitation and inherently add a huge amount of attack surface. Gecko doesn't have
            a WebView implementation, so it has to be used alongside the Chromium-based WebView
            rather than instead of Chromium, which means having the remote attack surface of two
            separate browser engines instead of only one. Firefox / Gecko also bypass or cripple a
            fair bit of the upstream and GrapheneOS hardening work for apps. Worst of all, Firefox
            runs as a single process on mobile and has no sandbox beyond the OS sandbox. This is
            despite the fact that Chromium semantic sandbox layer on Android is implemented via
            the OS <code>isolatedProcess</code> feature, which is a very easy to use boolean
            property for app service processes to provide strong isolation with only the ability
            to communicate with the app running them via the standard service API. Even in the
            desktop version, Firefox's sandbox is still substantially weaker (especially on Linux,
            where it can hardly be considered a sandbox at all) and lacks support for isolating
            sites from each other rather than only containing content as a whole.</p>
