            <section id="accessibility">
                <h2><a href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS includes all of the accessibility features from the Android Open
                Source Project and strives to fill in the gaps from not including Google apps and
                services. We include our own fork of the open source TalkBack and Switch Access
                accessibility services along with a Monochromacy option for the standard color
                correction menu.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS does not yet include a text-to-speech (TTS) service in the base OS
                due to limitations of the available options. Including one is planned in the
                future when a suitable option is available. RHVoice and eSpeak NG are both open
                source and are the most common choices by GrapheneOS users. Both of these mostly
                work fine but have licensing issues and don't support Direct Boot so they cannot
                be used before the initial unlock of the device. Installing and setting up either
                one of these or another TTS app will get TalkBack working. TalkBack itself
                supports Direct Boot and works before the first unlock but it needs to have a TTS
                app supporting it in order to do more than playing the activation sound before the
                first unlock. After installing a TTS service, you need to select it in the OS
                configuration to accept activating it. The OS will display one of them as already
                selected, but it won't simply work from being installed as that wouldn't be safe.
                This is the same as the stock OS but it comes with one set up already.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS disables showing the characters as passwords are typed by default.
                You can enable this in Settings ➔ Privacy.</p>

                <p>Third party accessibility services can be installed and activated. This
                includes the ones made by Google. Most of these will work but some may have a hard
                dependency on functionality from Google Play services for some of their
                functionality or to run at all. Accessibility services are very powerful and we
                strongly recommend against using third party implementations if you can get by
                well without them. We plan to add safeguards in this area while still keeping them
                working without problematic barriers.</p>

            <section id="system-navigation">
                <h2><a href="#system-navigation">System navigation</a></h2>

                <p>By default, GrapheneOS uses gesture-based navigation. We recommend reading our
                guide on gesture navigation and giving it a chance even if you think you won't
                like it. Our experience is that when armed with the appropriate knowledge, the
                vast majority of users prefer the newer gesture navigation approach.</p>

                <p>The system navigation mode can be configured in Settings → System → Gestures →
                System navigation. The same menu is also available in Settings → Accessibility →
                System navigation.</p>

                <section id="gesture-navigation">
                    <h3><a href="#gesture-navigation">Gesture navigation</a></h3>

                    <p>The bottom of the screen is a reserved touch zone for system navigation. A
                    line is displayed in the center to show that the navigation bar is present
                    across the entire bottom of the screen. In most apps, this area will display
                    padding. Modern apps are able to tell the OS that they can handle not having
                    the padding to display app content there while still not being able to receive
                    touches from it. Open up the Settings app for an example.</p>

                    <p>Swiping up from the navigation bar while removing your finger from the
                    screen is the <strong>Home</strong> gesture.</p>

                    <p>Swiping up from the navigation bar while holding your finger on the screen
                    before releasing is the <strong>Recent Apps</strong> gesture. The most
                    recently opened activity is always on the furthest right. Each step left goes
                    one step back through the history of recently opened apps. Opening an app with
                    the recent apps activity will place it on the furthest right in the recent
                    apps order just like a new app being opened.</p>

                    <p>The recent apps activity has a screenshot button as an alternative to
                    holding power and volume down while using an app.</p>

                    <p>Rather than opening the recent apps activity, you can swipe left on the
                    navigation bar for the <strong>Previous</strong> app and swipe right for the
                    <strong>Next</strong> app. This will not change the recent apps order. This is
                    usually the best way to navigate through recent apps.</p>

                    <p>Swiping from either the left or the right of the screen within the app (not
                    the navigation bar) is the <strong>Back</strong> gesture. Apps are supposed to
                    avoid implementing conflicting gestures, but have the option to override this
                    gesture if they truly need to get rid of it. However, many apps without active
                    development of their UI design still haven't addressed this despite gestures
                    being the default for 2 years on Google Android. You can avoid triggering the
                    back gesture in one of 2 easy ways: avoid swiping from right near the edge or
                    hold your finger on the side of the screen for a moment before swiping. The
                    more advanced option is using a diagonal swipe pointing sharply to the bottom
                    of the screen since this will bypass the back gesture but will still trigger
                    most app gestures. The advanced option is the most convenient approach once
                    you get used to doing it.</p>

                    <p>The launcher uses a swipe up gesture starting anywhere on the screen to
                    open the app drawer from the home screen. You need to start that gesture above
                    the system navigation bar since any gesture starting on the navigation bar is
                    handled by the OS as a system navigation gesture.</p>

                <section id="2-button-navigation">
                    <h3><a href="#2-button-navigation">2-button navigation</a></h3>

                    <p>2-button navigation is a legacy mode not supported anymore by Google
                    Android on the Pixel 4 and later. It will likely be removed in a future
                    release of GrapheneOS. You should use <a href="#3-button-navigation">3-button
                    navigation</a> if you want the traditional button-based navigation.</p>

                    <p>A large row across the bottom of the screen is reserved for navigation
                    buttons. The <strong>Back</strong> button is on the left and the
                    <strong>Home</strong> button is in the center.</p>

                    <p>Swiping up from the navigation bar while removing your finger from the
                    screen is the <strong>Recent apps</strong> gesture. The most recently opened
                    activity is always on the furthest right. Each step left goes one step back
                    through the history of recently opened apps. Opening an app with the recent
                    apps activity will place it on the furthest right in the recent apps
                    order just like a new app being opened.</p>

                    <p>2-button navigation provides the recent apps activity with the launcher. It
                    shows the recent apps above the bottom row of the home screen and the search
                    integration not used in GrapheneOS. The usual launcher features work including
                    swiping up anywhere on the screen to open the app drawer. Due to the launcher
                    integration, the screenshot button available in the other modes isn't present.
                    Instead, a screenshot button is added to the global action menu accessed by
                    holding the power button.</p>

                <section id="3-button-navigation">
                    <h3><a href="#3-button-navigation">3-button navigation</a></h3>

                    <p>3-button navigation is Android's oldest touchscreen-based navigation
                    system. It will remain supported for the foreseeable future to provide
                    accessibility for users unable to easily use the gestures. It's older than
                    2-button navigation but isn't considered a legacy feature.</p>

                    <p>A large row across the bottom of the screen is reserved for navigation
                    buttons. The <strong>Back</strong> button is on the left, the
                    <strong>Home</strong> button is in the center and the <strong>Recent
                    Apps</strong> button is on the right.</p>

                    <p>In the recent apps activity, the most recently opened activity is always on
                    the furthest right. Each step left goes one step back through the history of
                    recently opened apps. Opening an app with the recent apps activity will place
                    it on the furthest right in the recent apps order just like a new app being
                    opened.</p>

                    <p>The recent apps activity has a screenshot button as an alternative to
                    holding power and volume down while using an app.</p>

                <h2><a href="#updates">Updates</a></h2>

                <p>The update system implements automatic background updates. It checks for updates
                approximately once every four hours when there's network connectivity and then
                downloads and installs updates in the background. It will pick up where it left off if
                downloads are interrupted, so you don't need to worry about interrupting it.
                Similarly, interrupting the installation isn't a risk because updates are installed to
                a secondary installation of GrapheneOS which only becomes the active installation
                after the update is complete. Once the update is complete, you'll be informed with a
                notification and simply need to reboot with the button in the notification or via a
                normal reboot. If the new version fails to boot, the OS will be rolled back to the
                past version and the updater will attempt to download and install the update
                again.</p>

                <p>The updater will use incremental (delta) updates to download only changes rather
                than the whole OS when one is available to go directly from the installed version to
                the latest version. As long as you have working network connectivity on a regular
                basis and reboot when asked, you'll almost always be on one of the past couple
                versions of the OS which will minimize bandwidth usage since incrementals will always
                be available.</p>

                <p>The updater works while the device is locked / idle, including before the first
                unlock since it's explicitly designed to be able to run before decryption of user
                data.</p>

                <p>Release changelogs are available <a href="/releases#changelog">in a section on the releases page</a>.</p>

                <section id="updates-settings">
                    <h3><a href="#updates-settings">Settings</a></h3>

                    <p>The settings are available in the Settings app in System ➔ Advanced ➔ Update
                    settings.</p>

                    <p>The "Check for updates" option will manually trigger an update check as soon as
                    possible. It will still wait for the configuration conditions listed below to be
                    satisfied, such as being connected to the internet via one of the permitted network
                    types.</p>

                    <p>The "Release channel" setting can be changed from the default Stable channel to the
                    Beta channel if you want to help with testing. The Beta channel will usually simply
                    follow the Stable channel, but the Beta channel may be used to experiment with new
                    features.</p>

                    <p>The "Permitted networks" setting controls which networks will be used to perform
                    updates. It defaults to using any network connection. It can be set to "Non-roaming"
                    to disable it when the cellular service is marked as roaming or "Unmetered" to disable
                    it on cellular networks and also Wi-Fi networks marked as metered.</p>

                    <p>The "Require battery above warning level" setting controls whether updates will
                    only be performed when the battery is above the level where the warning message is

                    <p>Enabling the opt-in "Automatic reboot" setting allows the updater to reboot the

                    enabled, a device can take care of any number of updates completely automatically even

                    <p>The update server isn't a trusted party since updates are signed and verified along
                    with downgrade attacks being prevented. The update protocol doesn't send identifiable
                    information to the update server and works well over a VPN / Tor. GrapheneOS isn't
                    able to comply with a government order to build, sign and ship a malicious update to a
                    specific user's device based on information like the IMEI, serial number, etc. The
                    update server only ends up knowing the IP address used to connect to it and the

                    <p>Android updates can support serialno constraints to make them validate only on a

                    permitted networks if the bandwidth usage is a problem on your mobile data connection.
                    However, it's possible to turn off the update client by going to Settings ➔ Apps,

                    <a href="https://grapheneos.org/releases">the releases page</a> and installed via recovery
                    with adb sideloading. The zip files are signed and verified by recovery, just as they
                    are by the update client within the OS. This includes providing downgrade protection,
                    which prevents attempting to downgrade the version. If recovery didn't enforce these
                    things, they would still be enforced via verified boot including downgrade protection
                    and the attempted update would just fail to boot and be rolled back.</p>

                    <p>To install one by sideloading, first, boot into recovery. You may do this either by
                    using <code>adb reboot recovery</code> from the operating system, or by selecting the
                    "Recovery" option in the bootloader interface.</p>

                    <p>You should see the green Android lying on its back being repaired, with the text "No
                    command" meaning that no command has been passed to recovery.</p>

                    <p>Next, access the recovery menu by holding down the power button and pressing the volume
                    up button a single time. This key combination toggles between the GUI and text-based mode
                    with the menu and log output.</p>

                    <p>Finally, select the "Apply update from ADB" option in the recovery menu and
                    sideload the update with adb. For example:</p>

                    <pre>adb sideload blueline-ota_update-2019.07.01.21.zip</pre>

                    <p><strong>You do not need to have adb enabled within the OS or the host's ADB key
                    whitelisted within the OS to sideload an update to recovery. Recovery mode does not
                    trust the attached computer and this can be considered a production feature. Trusting
                    a computer with ADB access within the OS is much different and exposes the device to a
                    huge amount of attack surface and control by the trusted computer.</strong></p>

            <section id="web-browsing">
                <h2><a href="#web-browsing">Web browsing</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS includes a Vanadium subproject providing privacy and security enhanced
                releases of Chromium. Vanadium is both the user-facing browser included in the OS and
                the provider of the WebView used by other apps to render web content. The WebView is
                the browser engine used by the vast majority of web browsers and nearly all other apps
                embedding web content or using web technologies for other uses.</p>

                <p>Using Vanadium is highly recommended. Bromite is a solid alternative and is the
                only other browser we recommend. Bromite provides integrated ad-blocking and more
                advanced anti-fingerprinting. For now, Vanadium is more focused on security hardening
                and Bromite is more focused on anti-fingerprinting. The projects are collaborating
                together and will likely converge to providing more of the same features. Vanadium
                will be providing content filtering and anti-fingerprinting, but it needs to be done
                in a way that meets the standards of the project, which takes time.</p>

                <p>Vanadium is designed for use on GrapheneOS and does not duplicate the OS privacy
                and security features such as the hardened malloc implementation. This leads to some
                of the differences from Bromite, such as relying on OS support for encrypted DNS
                rather than enabling Chromium's DNS-over-HTTPS support.</p>

                <p>Chromium-based browsers like Vanadium and Bromite provide the strongest sandbox
                implementation, leagues ahead of the alternatives. It is much harder to escape from
                the sandbox and it provides much more than acting as a barrier to compromising the
                rest of the OS. Site isolation enforces security boundaries around each site using the
                sandbox by placing each site into an isolated sandbox. It required a huge overhaul of
                the browser since it has to enforce these rules on all the IPC APIs. Site isolation is
                important even without a compromise, due to side channels. Browsers without site
                isolation are very vulnerable to attacks like Spectre. On mobile, due to the lack of
                memory available to apps, there are different modes for site isolation. Vanadium turns
                on strict site isolation, matching Chromium on the desktop. Bromite enables strict
                site isolation on high memory devices, including all the devices that are officially
                supported by GrapheneOS.</p>

                <p>Chromium has decent exploit mitigations, unlike the available alternatives. This is
                improved upon in Vanadium by enabling further mitigations, including those developed
                upstream but not yet fully enabled due to code size, memory usage or performance. For
                example, it enables type-based CFI like Chromium on the desktop, uses a stronger SSP
                configuration, zero initializes variables by default, etc. Some of the mitigations are
                inherited from the OS itself, which also applies to other browsers, at least if they
                don't do things to break them.</p>

                <p>We recommend against trying to achieve browser privacy and security through piling
                on browser extensions and modifications. Most privacy features for browsers are
                privacy theater without a clear threat model and these features often reduce privacy
                by aiding fingerprinting and adding more state shared between sites. Every change you
                make results in you standing out from the crowd and generally provides more ways to
                track you. Enumerating badness via content filtering is not a viable approach to
                achieving decent privacy, just as AntiVirus isn't a viable way to achieving decent
                security. These are losing battles, and are at best a stopgap reducing exposure while
                waiting for real privacy and security features.</p>

                <p>Vanadium will be following the school of thought where hiding the IP address
                through Tor or a trusted VPN shared between many users is the essential baseline, with
                the browser partitioning state based on site and mitigating fingerprinting to avoid
                that being trivially bypassed. The Tor Browser's approach is the only one with any
                real potential, however flawed the current implementation may be. This work is
                currently in a very early stage and it is largely being implemented upstream with the
                strongest available implementation of state partitioning. Chromium is using Network
                Isolation Keys to divide up connection pools, caches and other state based on site and
                this will be the foundation for privacy. Chromium itself aims to prevent tracking
                through mechanisms other than cookies, greatly narrowing the scope downstream work
                needs to cover. Bromite is doing a lot of work in these areas and Vanadium will be
                benefiting from that along with this upstream work. The focus is currently on research
                since we don't see much benefit in deploying bits and pieces of this before everything
                is ready to come together. At the moment, the only browser with any semblance of
                privacy is the Tor Browser but there are many ways to bypass the anti-fingerprinting
                and state partitioning. The Tor Browser's security is weak which makes the privacy
                protection weak. The need to avoid diversity (fingerprinting) creates a monoculture
                for the most interesting targets. This needs to change, especially since Tor itself
                makes people into much more of a target (both locally and by the exit nodes).</p>

                <p>WebView-based browsers use the hardened Vanadium rendering engine, but they can't
                offer as much privacy and control due to being limited to the capabilities supported
                by the WebView widget. For example, they can't provide a setting for toggling sensors
                access because the feature is fairly new and the WebView WebSettings API doesn't yet
                include support for it as it does for JavaScript, location, cookies, DOM storage and
                other older features. For sensors, the Sensors app permission added by GrapheneOS can
                be toggled off for the browser app as a whole instead. The WebView sandbox also
                currently runs every instance within the same sandbox and doesn't support site
                isolation.</p>

                <p>Avoid Gecko-based browsers like Firefox as they're currently much more vulnerable
                to exploitation and inherently add a huge amount of attack surface. Gecko doesn't have
                a WebView implementation (GeckoView is not a WebView implementation), so it has to be
                used alongside the Chromium-based WebView rather than instead of Chromium, which means
                having the remote attack surface of two separate browser engines instead of only one.
                Firefox / Gecko also bypass or cripple a fair bit of the upstream and GrapheneOS
                hardening work for apps. Worst of all, Firefox runs as a single process on mobile and
                has no sandbox beyond the OS sandbox. This is despite the fact that Chromium semantic
                sandbox layer on Android is implemented via the OS <code>isolatedProcess</code>
                feature, which is a very easy to use boolean property for app service processes to
                provide strong isolation with only the ability to communicate with the app running
                them via the standard service API. Even in the desktop version, Firefox's sandbox is
                still substantially weaker (especially on Linux, where it can hardly be considered a
                sandbox at all) and lacks support for isolating sites from each other rather than only
                containing content as a whole.</p>

                <h2><a href="#camera">Camera</a></h2>

                <p>The Camera app included in GrapheneOS is very basic and can't take full advantage
                of the hardware. It doesn't offer much in the way of configuration. In the long term,
                it's going to be replaced. In the short term, there are other apps available providing
                more capabilities and better support for taking advantage of the hardware.</p>

                <p>The Pixel 3 (but not the Pixel 3a) and Pixel 4 (but not the Pixel 4a) have a
                Pixel Visual Core / Pixel Neural Core providing a hardware-based implementation of
                HDR+. HDR+ captures many images and intelligently merges data across them, taking
                into account motion, etc. It substantially improves the quality of images,
                especially in low light. This is used transparently for third party apps that are
                compatible with it, and there isn't an explicit switch to turn it on or off for
                most of them. An example of a compatible app is Open Camera's default
                configuration, or Open Camera with the Camera 2 API and other settings (including
                the the various knobs / toggles outside of the settings menu) left alone. In
                general, HDR+ will work transparently in most apps as long as they keep things
                simple and use a good minimalist approach to taking pictures. It should work
                transparently in most messaging apps, etc. with internal support for taking
                pictures.</p>

                <p>In addition to supporting HDR+ via the Pixel Visual Core, or similar features on
                other devices with the same constraints, Open Camera offers advanced configuration and
                various advanced features. Make sure to enable the Camera 2 API in the settings, which
                should be the default, but the app doesn't have a great user interface / user
                experience. You probably don't want to use the traditional HDR feature in the app.
                That's not HDR+, but rather captures 3 images and merges them in a way that isn't at
                all intelligent and causes a lot of blur and distortion. The HDR+ implementation can
                actually benefit from the camera not being completely steady as it's smart enough to
                match up the picture and it provides it with more data vs. a traditional HDR
                implementation where it essentially doesn't work without a tripod and is not really at
                all useful on a phone unless you actually have that for it.</p>

            <section id="exec-spawning">
                <h2><a href="#exec-spawning">Exec spawning</a></h2>

                <p>GrapheneOS creates fresh processes (via exec) when spawning applications instead of
                using the traditional Zygote spawning model. This improves privacy and security at the
                expense of higher cold start app spawning time and higher initial memory usage. It
                doesn't impact runtime performance beyond the initial spawning time. It adds somewhere
                in the ballpark of 100ms to app spawning time on the flagship devices and is only very
                noticeable on lower-end devices with a weaker CPU and slower storage. The spawning
                time impact only applies when the app doesn't already have an app process and the OS
                will try to keep app processes cached in the background until memory pressure forces
                it to start killing them.</p>

                <p>In the typical Zygote model, a template app process is created during boot and
                every app is spawned as a clone of it. This results in every app sharing the same
                initial memory content and layout, including sharing secrets that are meant to be
                randomized for each process. It saves time by reusing the initialization work. The
                initial memory usage is reduced due to copy-on-write semantics resulting in memory
                written only during initialization being shared between app processes.</p>

                <p>The Zygote model weakens the security provided by features based on random secrets
                including Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), stack canaries, heap canaries,
                randomized heap layout and memory tags. It cripples these security features since
                every app has the values for every other app and the values don't change for fresh app
                processes until reboot. Much of the OS itself is implemented via non-user-facing apps
                with privileges reserved for OS components. The Zygote template is reused across user
                profiles, so it also provides a temporary set of device identifiers across profiles
                for each boot via the shared randomized values.</p>

                <p>GrapheneOS substantially expands the standard mitigations for memory corruption
                vulnerabilities. Some of these features are designed to directly catch the memory
                corruption bugs either via an explicit check or memory protection and abort the
                program in order to prevent them from being exploited. Other features mitigate issues
                a bit less directly such as zeroing data immediately upon free, isolated memory
                regions, heap randomization, etc. and can also lead to latent memory corruption bugs
                crashing instead of the program continuing onwards with corrupted memory. This means
                that many latent memory corruption bugs in apps are caught along with some in the OS
                itself. These bugs are not caused by GrapheneOS, but rather already existed and are
                uncovered by the features. The features are aimed at preventing or hindering exploits,
                not finding bugs, but they do that as part of doing their actual job.</p>

                <p>Similarly, some of the other privacy and security improvements reduce the access
                available to applications and they may crash. Some of these features are always
                enabled under the hood, while others like the Network and Sensors toggles are
                controlled by users via opt-in or opt-out toggles. Apps may not handle having access
                taken away like this, although it generally doesn't cause any issues as it's all
                designed to be friendly to apps and fully compatible rather than killing the
                application when it violates the rules.</p>

                <p>If you run into an application aborting, try to come up with a process for

                more difficult to debug if you provide less of the information. If the app
                doesn't work with sensitive information, just send the whole tombstone.</p>

                <h2><a href="#wifi-privacy">Wi-Fi privacy</a></h2>

                <p>Wi-Fi on GrapheneOS is very privacy-friendly and is essentially anonymous as long
                as apps do not leak uniquely identifying information to the network. GrapheneOS avoids
                allowing itself to be fingerprinted as GrapheneOS, other than connections which are
                documented (see the FAQ) and can be easily disabled or forced through a VPN
                service.</p>

                <section id="wifi-privacy-scanning">
                    <h3><a href="#wifi-privacy-scanning">Scanning</a></h3>

                    <p>MAC randomization is always performed for Wi-Fi scanning. Pixel
                    phones have firmware support for scanning MAC randomization going
                    <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html">significantly beyond a naive implementation</a>.
                    On many other devices, there are identifiers exposed by Wi-Fi scanning beyond the MAC
                    address such as the packet sequence number and assorted identifying information in the
                    probe requests.</p>

                    <p>Avoid using hidden APs (i.e. APs not broadcasting their SSID) since all
                    known hidden SSIDs end up being broadcast as part of scanning for networks to
                    find them again. SSIDs are not broadcast for standard non-hidden APs. Hidden
                    APs are only hidden when no devices are connected. It makes little sense as a
                    privacy feature, especially for a non-mobile AP where knowing the AP exists
                    can't be used for tracking it since it doesn't move. The feature reduces your
                    privacy rather than increasing it. If you need to use a hidden AP, make sure
                    to delete the saved network afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning for improving location detection are disabled by
                    default, unlike the stock OS. These can be toggled in Settings ➔ Location ➔ Wi-Fi and
                    Bluetooth scanning. These features enable scanning even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is
                    disabled, so these need to be kept disabled to fully disable the radios when Wi-Fi and
                    Bluetooth are disabled. GrapheneOS doesn't yet have an implementation of a coarse
                    location service to supplement GPS location, so enabling these options doesn't
                    actually do anything at the moment. Implementing a supplementary location service is
                    planned but we need a robust, secure and private implementation via a local database.
                    The initial focus will likely be a cell phone tower database, so these features still
                    wouldn't be relevant.</p>

                <section id="wifi-privacy-associated">
                    <h3><a href="#wifi-privacy-associated">Associated with an Access Point (AP)</a></h3>

                    <p>Associated MAC randomization is performed by default. This can be controlled
                    per-network with Settings ➔ Network &amp; Internet ➔ Wi-Fi ➔ &lt;network&gt; ➔
                    Advanced  ➔ Privacy.</p>

                    <p>In the stock OS, the default is to use a unique persistent random MAC address for
                    each network. It has 2 options available: "Use randomized MAC (default)" and "Use
                    device MAC". In GrapheneOS, the default is generating a new random MAC address when
                    connecting to a network. It has 3 options available: "Use fully randomized MAC
                    (default)", "Use per-network randomized MAC" and "Use device MAC".</p>

                    <p>The DHCP client uses the anonymity profile rather than sending a hostname
                    so it doesn't compromise the privacy offered by MAC randomization. When the
                    per-connection MAC randomization added by GrapheneOS is being used, DHCP
                    client state is flushed before reconnecting to a network to avoid revealing
                    that it's likely the same device as before.</p>

                    <p>GrapheneOS also disables support for stable link-local IPv6 addresses, since these
                    have the potential to be used as identifiers. It's more sensible to use typical
                    link-local address generation based on the (randomized) MAC address since link-local
                    devices have access to both. As of Android 11, Android only uses stable link-local
                    privacy addresses when MAC randomization is disabled, so we no longer need to disable
                    the feature.</p>

            <section id="lte-only-mode">
                <h2><a href="#lte-only-mode">LTE-only mode</a></h2>

                <p>If you have a reliable LTE connection from your carrier, you can reduce attack
                surface by disabling 2G / 3G connectivity in Settings ➔ Network &amp; Internet ➔
                Mobile network ➔ Preferred network type. Traditional voice calls will only work in
                the LTE-only mode if you have either an LTE connection and VoLTE (Voice over LTE)
                support or a Wi-Fi connection and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi) support. VoLTE /
                VoWi-Fi works on GrapheneOS for most carriers unless they restrict it to carrier
                phones. US carriers other than T-Mobile tend to be missing these features due to
                us not including their proprietary apps.</p>

                <p>This feature is not intended to improve the confidentiality of traditional calls and
                texts, but it might somewhat raise the bar for some forms of interception. It's not a
                substitute for end-to-end encrypted calls / texts or even transport layer encryption.
                LTE does provide basic network authentication / encryption, but it's for the network
                itself. The intention of the LTE-only feature is only hardening against remote
                exploitation by disabling an enormous amount of legacy code.</p>
