            <p>This is a guide covering some aspects of using GrapheneOS. It's not intended to be
            an overview of the privacy and security features implemented by GrapheneOS. It will
            only cover the user-facing impact of features, and most of the privacy and security
            work is done under the hood.</p>

            <h2 id="updates">
                <a href="#updates">Updates</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The update system implements automatic background updates. It checks for updates
            approximately once every four hours when there's network connectivity and then
            downloads and installs updates in the background. It will pick up where it left off if
            downloads are interrupted, so you don't need to worry about interrupting it.
            Similarly, interrupting the installation isn't a risk because updates are installed to
            a secondary installation of GrapheneOS which only becomes the active installation
            after the update is complete. Once the update is complete, you'll be informed with a
            notification and simply need to reboot with the button in the notification or via a
            normal reboot. If the new version fails to boot, the OS will be rolled back to the
            past version and the updater will attempt to download and install the update
            again.</p>

            <p>The updater will use incremental (delta) updates to download only changes rather
            than the whole OS when one is available to go directly from the installed version to
            the latest version. As long as you have working network connectivity on a regular
            basis and reboot when asked, you'll almost always be on one of the past couple
            versions of the OS which will minimize bandwidth usage since incrementals will always
            be available.</p>

            <p>The updater works while the device is locked / idle, including before the first
            unlock since it's explicitly designed to be able to run before decryption of user
            data.</p>

            <p>Release changelogs are available <a href="/releases#changelog">in a section on the releases page</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-settings">
                <a href="#updates-settings">Settings</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The settings are available in the Settings app in System ➔ Advanced ➔ Update
            settings.</p>

            <p>The "Check for updates" option will manually trigger an update check as soon as
            possible. It will still wait for the configuration conditions listed below to be
            satisfied, such as being connected to the internet via one of the permitted network
            types.</p>

            <p>The "Release channel" setting can be changed from the default Stable channel to the
            Beta channel if you want to help with testing. The Beta channel will usually simply
            follow the Stable channel, but the Beta channel may be used to experiment with new
            features.</p>

            <p>The "Permitted networks" setting controls which networks will be used to perform
            updates. It defaults to using any network connection. It can be set to "Non-roaming"
            to disable it when the cellular service is marked as roaming or "Unmetered" to disable
            it on cellular networks and also Wi-Fi networks marked as metered.</p>

            <p>The "Require battery above warning level" setting controls whether updates will
            only be performed when the battery is above the level where the warning message is
            shown. The standard value is at 15% capacity.</p>

            <p>Enabling the opt-in "Automatic reboot" setting allows the updater to reboot the
            device after an update once it has been idle for a long time. When this setting is
            enabled, a device can take care of any number of updates completely automatically even
            if it's left completely idle.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-security">
                <a href="#updates-security">Security</a>
            </h3>

            <p>The update server isn't a trusted party since updates are signed and verified along
            with downgrade attacks being prevented. The update protocol doesn't send identifiable
            information to the update server and works well over a VPN / Tor. GrapheneOS isn't
            able to comply with a government order to build, sign and ship a malicious update to a
            specific user's device based on information like the IMEI, serial number, etc. The
            update server only ends up knowing the IP address used to connect to it and the
            version being upgraded from based on the requested incremental.</p>

            <p>Android updates can support serialno constraints to make them validate only on a
            certain device but GrapheneOS rejects any update with a serialno constraint for both
            the Stable and Beta channels.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-disabling">
                <a href="#updates-disabling">Disabling</a>
            </h3>

            <p>It's highly recommended to leave automatic updates enabled and to configure the
            permitted networks if the bandwidth usage is a problem on your mobile data connection.
            However, it's possible to turn off the update client by going to Settings ➔ Apps,
            enabling Show system via the menu, selecting Seamless Update Client and disabling the
            app.  If you do this, you'll need to remember to enable it again to start receiving
            updates.</p>

            <h3 id="updates-sideloading">
                <a href="#updates-sideloading">Sideloading</a>
            </h3>

            <p>Updates can be downloaded via
            <a href="https://grapheneos.org/releases">the releases page</a> and installed via recovery
            with adb sideloading. The zip files are signed and verified by recovery, just as they
            are by the update client within the OS. This includes providing downgrade protection,
            which prevents attempting to downgrade the version. If recovery didn't enforce these
            things, they would still be enforced via verified boot including downgrade protection
            on modern devices (Pixel 2 and later) and the attempted update would just fail to boot
            and be rolled back.</p>

            <p>To install one by sideloading, first, boot into recovery. You may do this either by
            using <code>adb reboot recovery</code> from the operating system, or by selecting the
            "Recovery" option in the bootloader menu.</p>

            <p>You should see the green Android lying on its back being repaired, with the text "No
            command" meaning that no command has been passed to recovery.</p>

            <p>Next, access the recovery menu by holding down the power button and pressing the volume
            up button a single time. This key combination toggles between the GUI and text-based mode
            with the menu and log output.</p>

            <p>Finally, select the "Apply update from ADB" option in the recovery menu and
            sideload the update with adb. For example:</p>

            <pre>adb sideload blueline-ota_update-2019.07.01.21.zip</pre>

            <p><strong>You do not need to have adb enabled within the OS or the host's ADB key
            whitelisted within the OS to sideload an update to recovery. Recovery mode does not
            trust the attached computer and this can be considered a production feature. Trusting
            a computer with ADB access within the OS is much different and exposes the device to a
            huge amount of attack surface and control by the trusted computer.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="web-browsing">
                <a href="#web-browsing">Web browsing</a>
            </h2>

            <p>GrapheneOS includes a Vanadium subproject providing privacy and security enhanced
            releases of Chromium. Vanadium is both the user-facing browser included in the OS and
            the provider of the WebView used by other apps to render web content. The WebView is
            the browser engine used by the vast majority of web browsers and nearly all other apps
            embedding web content or using web technologies for other uses.</p>

            <p>Using Vanadium is highly recommended and Bromite is a good alternative if you want
            a few more features like ad-blocking and more aggressive anti-fingerprinting. Vanadium
            is working towards including these features and is actively collaborating with
            Bromite. Standalone browsers based on Chromium have by far the best sandbox
            implementation. Site isolation can also be enabled, which makes the sandbox enforce a
            security boundary containing each site rather than isolating content as a whole.
            Vanadium enables site isolation by default, and Bromite enables it on high memory
            devices, including all officially supported GrapheneOS devices. Site isolation
            prevents an attacker from obtaining cookies (like login sessions) and other data tied
            to other sites if they successfully exploit the browser's rendering engine. It also
            provides the strongest available mitigation for Spectre-based side channel
            attacks.</p>

            <p>WebView-based browsers use the hardened Vanadium rendering engine, but they can't
            offer as much privacy and control due to being limited to the capabilities supported
            by the WebView widget. For example, they can't provide a setting for toggling sensors
            access because the feature is fairly new and the WebView WebSettings API doesn't yet
            include support for it as it does for JavaScript, location, cookies, DOM storage and
            other older features. For sensors, the Sensors app permission added by GrapheneOS can
            be toggled off for the browser app as a whole instead. The WebView sandbox also
            currently runs every instance within the same process and doesn't support site
            isolation.</p>

            <p>Avoid Gecko-based browsers like Firefox as they're currently much more vulnerable
            to exploitation and inherently add a huge amount of attack surface. Gecko doesn't have
            a WebView implementation (GeckoView is not a WebView implementation), so it has to be
            used alongside the Chromium-based WebView rather than instead of Chromium, which means
            having the remote attack surface of two separate browser engines instead of only one.
            Firefox / Gecko also bypass or cripple a fair bit of the upstream and GrapheneOS
            hardening work for apps. Worst of all, Firefox runs as a single process on mobile and
            has no sandbox beyond the OS sandbox. This is despite the fact that Chromium semantic
            sandbox layer on Android is implemented via the OS <code>isolatedProcess</code>
            feature, which is a very easy to use boolean property for app service processes to
            provide strong isolation with only the ability to communicate with the app running
            them via the standard service API. Even in the desktop version, Firefox's sandbox is
            still substantially weaker (especially on Linux, where it can hardly be considered a
            sandbox at all) and lacks support for isolating sites from each other rather than only
            containing content as a whole.</p>

            <h2 id="camera">
                <a href="#camera">Camera</a>
            </h2>

            <p>The Camera app included in GrapheneOS is very basic and can't take full advantage
            of the hardware. It doesn't offer much in the way of configuration. In the long term,
            it's going to be replaced. In the short term, there are other apps available providing
            more capabilities and better support for taking advantage of the hardware.</p>

            <p>The Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 (but not the Pixel 3a) have a Pixel Visual Core providing
            a hardware-based implementation of HDR+. HDR+ captures many images and intelligently
            merges data across them, taking into account motion, etc. It substantially improves
            the quality of images, especially in low light. This is used transparently for third
            party apps that are compatible with it, and there isn't an explicit switch to turn it
            on or off for most of them. An example of a compatible app is Open Camera's default
            configuration, or Open Camera with the Camera 2 API and other settings (including the
            the various knobs / toggles outside of the settings menu) left alone. In general, HDR+
            will work transparently in most apps as long as they keep things simple and use a good
            minimalist approach to taking pictures. It should work transparently in most messaging
            apps, etc. with internal support for taking pictures.</p>

            <p>In addition to supporting HDR+ via the Pixel Visual Core, or similar features on
            other devices with the same constraints, Open Camera offers advanced configuration and
            various advanced features. Make sure to enable the Camera 2 API in the settings, which
            should be the default, but the app doesn't have a great user interface / user
            experience. You probably don't want to use the traditional HDR feature in the app.
            That's not HDR+, but rather captures 3 images and merges them in a way that isn't at
            all intelligent and causes a lot of blur and distortion. The HDR+ implementation can
            actually benefit from the camera not being completely steady as it's smart enough to
            match up the picture and it provides it with more data vs. a traditional HDR
            implementation where it essentially doesn't work without a tripod and is not really at
            all useful on a phone unless you actually have that for it.</p>

            <h2 id="exec-spawning">
                <a href="#exec-spawning">Exec spawning</a>
            </h2>

            <p>You may notice that cold start app spawning time takes a bit longer (i.e. in the
            ballpark of 100ms) than stock Android, along with higher app memory usage. This is due
            to security centric exec spawning model used by GrapheneOS to provide each application
            with a unique address space layout, random hardened_malloc heap layout and unique keys
            / seeds for other probabilistic exploit mitigations like stack canaries, setjmp
            protection and future features like randomized memory tags. Exec spawning doesn't
            cause a performance cost after launching an app, and similarly doesn't cause any extra
            latency for app spawning if the app was already running / cached in the background. It
            isn't very noticeable on flagship devices with a high end CPU like a Pixel 3, and is a
            lot more noticeable on a lower end device like a Pixel 3a.</p>

            <h2 id="bugs-uncovered-by-security-features">
                <a href="#bugs-uncovered-by-security-features">Bugs uncovered by security features</a>
            </h2>

            <p>GrapheneOS substantially expands the standard mitigations for memory corruption
            vulnerabilities. Some of these features are designed to directly catch the memory
            corruption bugs either via an explicit check or memory protection and abort the
            program in order to prevent them from being exploited. Other features mitigate issues
            a bit less directly such as zeroing data immediately upon free, isolated memory
            regions, heap randomization, etc. and can also lead to latent memory corruption bugs
            crashing instead of the program continuing onwards with corrupted memory. This means
            that many latent memory corruption bugs in apps are caught along with some in the OS
            itself. These bugs are not caused by GrapheneOS, but rather already existed and are
            uncovered by the features. The features are aimed at preventing or hindering exploits,
            not finding bugs, but they do that as part of doing their actual job.</p>

            <p>Similarly, some of the other privacy and security improvements reduce the access
            available to applications and they may crash. Some of these features are always
            enabled under the hood, while others like the Network and Sensors toggles are
            controlled by users via opt-in or opt-out toggles. Apps may not handle having access
            taken away like this, although it generally doesn't cause any issues as it's all
            designed to be friendly to apps and fully compatible rather than killing the
            application when it violates the rules.</p>

            <p>If you run into an application aborting, try to come up with a process for
            reproducing the issue and then capture a bug report via the 'Take bug report' feature
            in Developer options. Report an issue to the GrapheneOS OS issue tracker and email the
            bug report capture zip to contact@grapheneos.org with the issue tracker number in the
            subject like "Bug report capture for issue #104". The bug report capture includes
            plain text 'tombstones' with logs, tracebacks, address space layout, register content
            and a tiny bit of context from memory from areas that are interesting for debugging.
            This may contain some sensitive data. Feel free to provide only the tombstone for the
            relevant crash and filter out information you don't want to send. However, it will be
            more difficult to debug if you provide less of the information. If the app doesn't
            work with sensitive information, just send the whole tombstone.</p>

            </h2>

            <p>Wi-Fi on GrapheneOS is very privacy-friendly and is essentially anonymous as long
            as apps do not leak uniquely identifying information to the network. GrapheneOS avoids
            allowing itself to be fingerprinted as GrapheneOS, other than connections which are
            documented (see the FAQ) and can be easily disabled or forced through a VPN
            service.</p>

            <h3 id="wifi-privacy-scanning">
                <a href="#wifi-privacy-scanning">Scanning</a>
            </h3>

            <p>MAC randomization is always performed for Wi-Fi scanning. Pixel
            phones have firmware support for scanning MAC randomization going
            <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html">significantly beyond a naive implementation</a>.
            On many other devices, there are identifiers exposed by Wi-Fi scanning beyond the MAC
            address such as the packet sequence number and assorted identifying information in the
            probe requests.</p>

            <p>Avoid using hidden APs (i.e. APs not broadcasting their SSID) since known hidden
            SSIDs end up being broadcast to find them again. SSIDs are not broadcast for standard
            non-hidden APs.</p>

            <p>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning for improving location detection are disabled by
            default, unlike the stock OS. These can be toggled in Settings ➔ Location ➔ Wi-Fi and
            Bluetooth scanning. These features enable scanning even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is
            disabled, so these need to be kept disabled to fully disable the radios when Wi-Fi and
            Bluetooth are disabled. GrapheneOS doesn't yet have an implementation of a coarse
            location service to supplement GPS location, so enabling these options doesn't
            actually do anything at the moment. Implementing a supplementary location service is
            planning but we need a robust, secure and private implementation via a local database.
            The initial focus will likely be a cell phone tower database, so these features still
            wouldn't be relevant.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>The DHCP client uses the anonymity profile rather than sending a hostname so it
            doesn't compromise the privacy offered by MAC randomization.</p>

            <p>Associated MAC randomization is performed by default. This can be controlled
            per-network with Settings ➔ Network &amp; Internet ➔ Wi-Fi ➔ &lt;network&gt; ➔
            Advanced  ➔ Privacy.</p>

            <p>In the stock OS, the default is to use a unique persistent random MAC address for
            each network. It has 2 options available: "Use randomized MAC (default)" and "Use
            device MAC". In GrapheneOS, the default is generating a new random MAC address when
            connecting to a network. It has 3 options available: "Use fully randomized MAC
            (default)", "Use per-network randomized MAC" and "Use device MAC".</p>
            
            <h2 id="lte-only-mode">
                <a href="#lte-only-mode">LTE-only mode</a>
            </h2>

            <p>If you have a reliable LTE connection from your carrier, you can reduce attack
            surface by disabling 2G / 3G connectivity in Settings ➔ Network &amp; Internet ➔ Mobile
            network ➔ Preferred network type. Traditional voice calls will only work in the LTE-only
            mode if you have either an LTE connection and VoLTE (Voice over LTE) support or a Wi-Fi
            connection and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi) support. Currently, VoLTE / VoWi-Fi works on
            GrapheneOS but not on most carriers, since the configuration and extra apps for them on 
            most carriers are not yet around.</p>

            <p>This feature is not intended to improve the confidentiality of traditional calls and
            texts, but it might somewhat raise the bar for some forms of interception. It's not a
            substitute for end-to-end encrypted calls / texts or even transport layer encryption.
            LTE does provide basic network authentication / encryption, but it's for the network
            itself. The intention of the LTE-only feature is only hardening against remote
            exploitation by disabling an enormous amount of legacy code.</p>
