The GrapheneOS IRC Channel Rules
================================
Last updated September 13 2020

Hello and welcome to the GrapheneOS IRC channel, which is bridged to
Matrix. We try to be welcoming and flexible and operate under the
honour system as much as possible, so please don't abuse it.

0. Rule Zero or the "Don't be a dick" rule applies. Don't engage
in harassment, spamming, trolling, or flame wars. Don't impersonate
developers or moderators, or spread misinformation.

1. Read the FAQ at https://grapheneos.org/faq in its entirety
prior to posting.

2. Don't engage in bikeshedding. Bikeshedding is the act of fussing
around trivialities that soak up mental bandwidth and divert resources
away from handling bigger and more important problems. This includes
certain topics such as:
    A) Apps, service providers, or protocols that don't come with
    GrapheneOS. Services such as mail, messaging, and cloud storage
    services, are outside of GrapheneOS control and off-topic.
    B) Operating systems outside of the context of building or
    installing GrapheneOS. Officially supported install operating
    systems are mentioned at https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
    C) Politics, such as comparing privacy laws in different
    jurisdictions. This is outside of GrapheneOS control.
    D) Hypothetical worst-case scenarios like backdoors, nationstate
    adversaries, intelligence agencies or "Three Letter Agencies" and
    their capabilities. This type of discussion just ends up being
    GrapheneOS versus your imagination. Code has limits, your
    imagination doesn't, and it's not useful to threat model against an
    adversary whose capabilities are hypothetical and unlimited.
    E) Software licenses. The licenses in GrapheneOS were chosen very
    deliberately to comply with future goals and aspirations of the project.

According to past experience, these topics descend into unresolvable ego-driven
disputes. Playing a game of "mine is bigger, more paranoid, private, technical,
or libre than yours" is extremely toxic and exhibits cult-like behaviour within
communities. We don't want #GrapheneOS to turn into a privacy cult so these
topics are currently embargoed.

With all that said, enjoy your stay and welcome to #GrapheneOS!
