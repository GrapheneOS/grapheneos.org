    <p>This app requires the Camera permission for the core functionality of the app. The
    Microphone permission is optional and only requested when starting video recording
    without disabling "Include Audio". Video can be recorded without granting Microphone
    access as long as "Include Audio" is disabled. Geotagging is disabled by default and
    enabling it will request the Location permission. The app doesn't require access to
    your media or other files. It stores files to the profile's Media Store and requests
    that they be placed in DCIM/Camera which doesn't require a permission. You can also
    choose to change the directory which will have you choose a directory for it to use
    via the system file manager.</p>

    <p>This app implements the system camera intent interfaces enabling other apps to use
    it to take pictures or record videos with explicit user consent. Only the resulting
    image or video explicitly captured by the user is given to the app. On Android 11 and
    later, only a system camera app can provide the system camera intents. This app is the
    system camera app on GrapheneOS where it provides that functionality. The handling of
    the intents is carefully designed to make it harder to trick users into accidentally
    capturing an image by implementing a delay.</p>

    <p>This app does not make any network connections and doesn't use any services. The
    app will never include any analytics/telemetry or any form of data collection. No
    connections will ever be made to a service without the user requesting it. It stores
    settings internally and pictures/videos captured by the user in Android's media store
    for the profile.</p>

    <p>Unlike nearly any other QR/barcode scanning apps, QR/barcode scanning does not open
    the resulting URL automatically.</p>
